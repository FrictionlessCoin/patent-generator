It is commonly known by law enforcement personnel that a great deal of officers who perform duties in nonuniform, and officers that are off duty find the several below cited traditional methods of carrying handcuffs to be uncomfortable and burdensome: When placed in the waistband, placed on the waistbelt or placed in the pocket. Some other reasons cited for the prior art not being satisfactory: The handcuffs are noisy, and officers frequently forget to transfer them from their on duty apparel to their off duty apparel.

[00004]

The present invention relates to a handcuff holder that attaches to most handgun holsters worn by law enforcement personnel. The method of attaching a handcuff holder to a handgun holster is believed to be a new concept over the prior art.

[00005]

It is therefore an object of the present invention to keep the handcuff holder together with the handgun holster.

[00006]

It is also the object of the invention to keep the handcuffs together with the handgun.

[00007]

It is also an object of this invention to be operated with the wearer's predominant hand.

According to the aforementioned and other objects, the present invention provides a handcuff holder that attaches to a handgun holster. The handcuff holder is attached to the handgun holster by a metal clip and a patch that is stitched to the handgun holster.

[00011]

The holder is comprised of two pieces. A metal piece that extends vertically down the side of the holster that is facing farthest away from the wearer's body with a clip on the back to assist in securing it to the holster. At the bottom of the holder is an open groove that holds the lower jaws and frames of the handcuffs. The other piece of the holder is a leather strap or similar material that is attached to the metal piece by a metal stud. The strap passes across the upper side of the handcuffs' frame that is facing farthest away from the wearer's body and continues over the top of the handcuffs and fastens to the metal piece of the holder via a fastener snap and a rivet, thereby, securing the handcuffs firmly in the holder. The handcuffs come instantly free for use with the releasable fastener snap.
