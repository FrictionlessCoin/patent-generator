[0001] Botanical designation: Helleborus×nigercors.

[0002] Cultivar denomination: ‘Candy Love’.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Helleborus, botanically known as Helleborus×nigercors, and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘Candy Love’.

[0004] The new Helleborus originated from a cross-pollination in Oostkamp, Belgium, of a proprietary selection of Helleborus niger designated as Wilgenbroek Selection, not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with a proprietary selection of Helleborus lividus, also designated as Wilgenbroek Selection, not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new Helleborus was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination grown in a controlled environment in Oostkamp, Belgium in 2005.

[0005] Asexual reproduction of the new Helleborus by vegetative cuttings in a controlled environment in Zandevoort, The Netherlands since 2005, has shown that the unique features of this new Helleborus are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0006] The cultivar Candy Love has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment and cultural practices such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype.

[0007] The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Candy Love’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Candy Love’ as a new and distinct cultivar of Helleborus:

[0008] 1. Upright and mounded plant habit.
[0009] 2. Strong and moderately vigorous growth habit.
[0010] 3. Numerous greenish white-colored flowers with reddish-colored margins.
[0011] 4. Long flowering period.
[0012] 5. Good garden performance.

[0013] Plants of the new Helleborus can be compared to plants of the parent selections. Plants of the new Helleborus are more freely flowering than plants of the parent selections and also differ in flower color.

[0014] Plants of the new Helleborus can be compared to plants of the Helleborus×nigercors cultivar Pink Beauty, not patented. Plants of the new Helleborus differ primarily from plants of the cultivar Pink Beauty in the following characteristics:

[0015] 1. Plants of the new Helleborus are taller than plants of the cultivar Pink Beauty.
[0016] 2. Plants of the new Helleborus have darker green-colored leaves than plants of the cultivar Pink Beauty.
[0017] 3. Plants of the new Helleborus are more freely flowering than plants of the cultivar Pink Beauty.
[0018] 4. Plants of the new Helleborus flower for a longer period of time than plants of the cultivar Pink Beauty.
[0019] 5. Plants of the new Helleborus and the cultivar Pink Beauty differ in flower color as plants of the cultivar Pink Beauty have light pink-colored flowers.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS

[0020] The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Helleborus, showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Helleborus.

[0021] The photograph at the top of the first sheet comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of ‘Candy Love’ grown in a container.

[0022] The photograph at the bottom of the first sheet is a close up view of a typical leaf of ‘Candy Love’.

[0023] The photograph on the second sheet is a close-up view of typical flowers of ‘Candy Love’.

DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION

[0024] The aforementioned photographs and following observations, measurements and values describe plants grown in Oostkamp, Belgium in containers during the winter in an outdoor nursery and under conditions which closely approximate commercial Helleborus production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from about 4° C. to about 15° C. and night temperatures ranged from about −1° C. to about 8° C. Plants were about one year old when the photographs and the description were taken. In the description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 2001 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
