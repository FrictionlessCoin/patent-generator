BACKGROUND

[00003]
1. Field of Invention

[00004]
This invention relates to a cosmetic for obscuring balding areas by enhancing the visibility of existing hair within the balding area and a novel method of application.

[00005]
2. Description Of Prior Art

[00006]
Baldness has been a problem, both for men and women, throughout the ages. A thinning scalp has long been a traditional sign of aging.

[00007]
People have used hair pieces, hair weaves, internal and externally applied medicines, hair transplant and scalp reduction surgeries, and many other means to try to avoid appearing bald. Some attempts have worked, but most have proven expensive, difficult and at best only partially successful.

SUMMART OF INVENTION

[00008]
In order to understand how the present invention works in hiding baldness, it helps to understand what baldness is to begin with.

[00009]
Male pattern baldness is in fact not generally a total elimination of all hair within a balding area, but instead a reduction of hair size, visibility and count within the balding area. Even an individual who has a clearly visible scalp generally has a substantial number of small hairs still left in the balding area. The problem is that the hairs that are left are too few, too translucent, and too small to visually cover the scalp.

[00010]
Baldness in women generally differs from that found in men. Instead of hairs shrinking in size and losing pigmentation and mass, women typically suffer a reduction in hair count over part or all of their scalp. What women share in common with men, however, is that the areas where the skin or scalp show through the hair usually still have hair, but hair in insufficient numbers and sizes to obscure the underlying epidermis.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

[00011]
The present invention takes advantage of remaining hair within a balding area by enlarging its size and enhancing its visibility. Specifically, the present invention thickens and adds pigment to the existing hairs which in turn, increases their prominence and visibility and thus obscures the underlying scalp or skin.

[00012]
Embodiments of the present invention work so well in fact, that both men and women who have clearly bald areas can cosmetically eliminate the areas in just a matter of several seconds.

[00013]
In a previous invention (Australian Patent No. 73,413/74) Kenneth Pond disclosed a composition which is inferior to embodiments using the present invention.

[00014]
Embodiments using aspects of our present invention may improve over embodiments using the previous invention in several areas. First, relative to the earlier first invention, embodiments using our present invention may create significantly less overspray (the airborne dust from an aerosol which is formed from aerosol agents which don't adhere to their target). Next, embodiments using our present invention may measurably decrease undesirable transfer of the baldness cosmetic onto clothing and other objects the hair may contact or come into proximity with. In addition, aspects of our present invention may noticeably soften the treated hair in and around the balding area both visually, and to the touch. Also, aspects of our present invention may make the hair look more natural by increasing its surface sheen. Finally, embodiments using our present invention may be resistant to being washed out in the rain or by heavy perspiration.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[00015]
Embodiments using our present invention may have up to four parts including: a colored hair thickener, a finishing spray, a hair cleanser and a special hair softener.

[00016]
Although all four above mentioned parts are not necessary to practice our present invention, the combination of the four parts produces very satisfactory results.

[00017]
A typical use of such a preferred embodiment may start with washing the hair using the present invention's hair cleanser. The hair is first wetted and the cleanser poured out of its bottle onto the hand and applied to the hair in conventional shampooing fashion.

[00018]
The hair cleanser of this embodiment may differ from many commercial shampoos in that it leaves little or no residue on the hair and underlying skin. This helps build static charge on the hair to attract the colored hair thickener. This is also intended to provide a clean surface to help the hair thickener and finishing spray, which will both be applied later, to better adhere to the hair and skin.

[00019]
The hair cleanser also may contain strengthened detergents which will remove water resistant resins which may be used in the hair thickener and/or in the finishing spray. Such water resistant resins may be present to prevent an embodiment from washing out in the rain or under heavy perspiration.

[00020]
After rinsing, drying and styling the hair in the normal manner, the colored hair thickener is applied from its aerosol can with the can nozzle held 3 to 6 inches from the balding area. This aerosol spray is applied directly on and around the hair and skin of the balding area. It is best to blend the application in the balding area with the surrounding hair for a more natural appearance.

[00021]
The hair thickener sticks to each hair shaft, increasing its mass, visibility and skin obscuring ability. It also coats the underlying skin, preventing direct skin observation regardless of the sufficiency of hair coverage. Providing adequate hair is present in the balding area, the bald spot, after the application of hair thickener, generally appears to be mostly or completely eliminated.

[00022]
After the hair thickener dries, the finishing spray may be applied from its aerosol can. Here the product is sprayed with the can nozzle held 8 to 12 inches from the area being sprayed, in a manner typical of applying a men's or women's hair styling spray.

[00023]
The finishing spray helps adhere the hair thickener to the hair shafts and skin. With proper formulation, it also may help add sheen to the surface of the hairs coated with the thickener. Also with proper formulation, such as the addition of water resistant resins, it may help prevent the thickener from being washed out in the rain or by heavy perspiration.

[00024]
Once the finishing spray has dried, the hair may be styled by lightly brushing its outer surface with a comb, or with a brush, such as an inexpensive coarse-toothed plastic styling brush. This is a light brushing which should not scrape the skin or scalp. Brushing the scalp can remove some or all of the hair thickener. This brushing besides moving the hair into place, may help soften the hair and blend the treated area with its surroundings.

[00025]
Removal of the hair thickener and finishing spray from the hair may be accomplished by again using the hair cleanser in the manner described above, or through use of any of a variety of conventionally available shampoos. This removal can be done at any time during or after the application of the colored hair thickener and finishing shield.

[00026]
It is important to note that there are many variations to the above procedure that may be practiced. As an example, it may not be necessary to use the hair cleanser prior to applying the hair thickener. Freshly washed hair is not even necessarily a requirement for an embodiment to work.

[00027]
Embodiments of the hair thickener may be applied and used without using a finishing spray. The finishing spray generally reduces the amount of hair thickener which may transfer onto clothing and other objects but is not essential for an embodiment to work.

[00028]
Another way to apply the hair thickener is to apply the finishing shield first, then apply the hair thickener before the finishing shield dries. This may then be followed, as an optional procedure, with another application of the finishing shield.

[00029]
The special hair softener's use is also optional. If it is used, it is applied any time after the hair thickener and finishing shield have been applied. The hair is wetted under a shower for just a few seconds without hand agitation. The special hair softener is then applied to the outer surface of the hair, again with minimal hand agitation. A final short rinse under the shower removes most of the special hair softener, but leaves the hair very soft in both the areas treated and untreated with hair thickener.

[00030]
One knowledgeable in the art will realize that there are many different formulations which can be used to practice the present invention. What follows is one exemplary embodiment of a formulation for the hair cleanser, hair thickener, finishing spray, and softener.

[00043]
Distinctive Features:

[00044]
One knowledgeable in the art will realize that the above hair cleanser leaves little or no residues on the hair and underlying skin, leaving both completely or close to completely clean. This helps in creating static change in the hair to attract the colored hair thickener. The cleanliness also helps the colored hair thickener and finishing spray adhere to the hair and skin once the thickener and finishing spray has been applied.

[00045]
Such a knowledgeable person will also realize that the detergents in the above are strong enough to remove water resistant resins, such as PVP/VA Copolymer and resyn 28-2930, which may be used in making the hair thickener and/or the finishing spray.

[00046]
Both the lack of residue causing agents and the use of detergents which are specifically directed to removing resins should be considered options, either or both of which may be absent from an embodiment practicing aspects of the present invention.
