[00018]

Among the preferred compounds of the invention, there can be mentioned more particularly those whose preparation is given hereafter in the experimental part and quite especially the compounds of Examples 1, 4 and 5.

[00019]

Also a subject of the invention is a preparation process for the compounds of formula (I) characterized in that a compound of formula (II): ##STR5## in which Hal represents a halogen atom, X and R.sub.4 retain their previous meaning, is subjected to the action of a compound of formula (III): ##STR6## in which R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.3 retain their previous meaning, in order to obtain the corresponding compound of formula (I).

[00021]

Hal preferably represents a bromine or iodine atom.

[00022]

The compounds of formula (II) are new products and are in themselves a subject of the present invention.

[00023]

The compounds of formula (II) can be prepared according to the reaction diagram: ##STR7##

[00024]

The starting product of formula (A) can be prepared according to the following process: ##STR8##

[00025]

The compounds of formula (II) can also be prepared according to the following reaction diagram: ##STR9##

[00026]

The experimental part set out hereafter gives examples of the preparation of the compounds of formula (II).

[00027]

The compounds of formula (I) have useful properties which allow their use for combating parasites. It can be for combating parasites of vegetation whether they be parasites of the soil or of the parts above ground, parasites of premises and parasites of animals.

[00028]

The compounds of formula (I) have insecticide, acaricide and nematicide properties as well as fungicide properties.

[00029]

The products of formula (I) can thus be used for combating insects in premises, for combating in particular flies, mosquitoes and cockroaches.

[00030]

The products of formula (I) can also be used to combat insects and other parasites of the soil, for example Coleoptera, such as Diabrotica, click beetles and May beetle grubs, Myriapoda such as Scutigeridae and blanjules, and Diptera such as Cecydomia and Lepidoptera such as owlet moths.

[00031]

The products of formula (I) also possess excellent acaricide activities as is shown by the results of the biological tests which appear hereafter.

[00032]

The products of formula (I) can also be used to combat parasitic acaridae of vegetation.

[00033]

The compounds of formula (I) can also be used to combat parasitic nematodes of vegetation.

[00034]

The compounds of formula (I) can also be used to combat parasitic acaridae of animals, to combat for example ticks and notably ticks of the Boophilus species, those of the Hyalomnia species, those of the Amblyomnia species and those of the Rhipicephalus species, or to combat all types of mites and in particular the sarcoptic mite, the psoroptic mite and the chorioptic mite.

[00035]

Therefore a subject of the invention is also the compositions intended for combating parasites of warm-blooded animals, parasites of premises and of vegetation, characterized in that they contain at least one of the products defined above.

[00036]

The compositions according to the invention are prepared according to the usual processes of the agro-chemical industry or the veterinary industry or the industry for products intended for animal nutrition.

[00037]

In these compositions intended for agricultural use and for use in premises, the active ingredient or ingredients can optionally have one or more other pesticide agents added to it/them. These compositions can be presented in the form of powders, granules, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, solutions for aerosols, combustible strips, baits or other preparations usually employed for the use of this type of compound.

[00038]

In addition to the active ingredient, these compositions contain, in general, a non-ionic vehicle and/or a surfactant, providing, moreover, a uniform dispersion of the constitutive substances of the mixture. The vehicle used can be a liquid, such as water, alcohol, hydrocarbons or other organic solvents, a mineral, animal or vegetable oil, a powder such as talc, clays, silicates, kieselguhr or a combustible solid.

[00039]

A particular subject of the invention is the insecticide compositions containing as active ingredient at least one of the products defined above.

[00040]

The insecticide compositions according to the invention preferably contain 0.005% to 10% by weight of active ingredient.

[00041]

According to an advantageous operating method, for a use in premises, the compositions according to the invention are used in the form of fumigant compositions.

[00042]

The compositions according to the invention can then be advantageously constituted, for the non-active part, by a combustible insecticide coil or also an incombustible fibrous substrate. In this last case, the fumigant obtained after incorporation of the active ingredient is placed on a heating apparatus such as an electric vaporizer.

[00043]

In the case where an insecticide coil is used, the inert support can be, for example, pyrethrum marc compound, Tabu powder (or Machilus Thumbergii leaf powder), pyrethrum stem powder, cedar leaf powder, sawdust (such as pine sawdust), starch and coconut shell powder.

[00044]

The dose of active ingredient can then be, for example, 0.03 to 1% by weight.

[00045]

In the case where an incombustible fibrous support is used, the dose of active ingredient can then be, for example, 0.03 to 95% by weight.

[00046]

The compositions according to the invention for a use in premises can also be obtained by preparing a sprayable oil based on the active ingredient, this oil impregnating the wick of a lamp and then being set alight.

[00047]

The concentration of active ingredient incorporated in the oil is, preferably, 0.03 to 95% by weight.

[00048]

The insecticide compositions according to the invention, such as the acaricide and nematicide compositions, can optionally have added to them one or more other pesticide agents. The acaricide and nematicide compositions can be presented in the form of powders, granules, suspensions, emulsions, solutions.

[00049]

In addition, a subject of the invention is the acaricide compositions containing as active ingredient at least one of the products of formula (I) as defined previously.

[00050]

For acaricide use, there are preferably used wettable powders, for foliar spraying, containing 1 to 80% by weight of active ingredient, or liquids for foliar spraying containing 1 to 500 g/l of active ingredient. Powders for foliar dustings can also be used containing 0.05 to 3% of active ingredient.

[00051]

For nematicide use, liquids are preferably used for soil treatment containing 300 to 500 g/l of active ingredient.

[00052]

The compounds of formula (I) have an excellent fungicide activity. They allow the combating of fungi which have already penetrated inside the tissues of vegetation. This is particularly useful in the case where it is no longer possible to combat diseases caused by fungi once the contamination has already taken place. The spectrum of activity of the compounds of formula (I) covers a great number of phytopathogenic fungi of varied economic importance, for example Pyricularia oryzae, Venturia inaequalis, Cercospora beticola, Erysiphicaceae (Sp. powdery mildew), Fusarium-, Drechslera- and Leptosphaeria-, Plasmopara viticola, Phytophtora infestans, Pseudoperonospora cubensis, various rusts, strains of Botrylis cinerea susceptible and resistant to BCM- and/or to Dicarboximide-, Sclerotinia solerotiorum, strains of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides-resistant to BMC and Pellicularia sasakii.

[00053]

Therefore a quite particular subject of the invention is the fungicide compositions containing as active ingredient at least one of the products of formula (I) as defined previously and more especially the fungicide compositions containing 0.001 to 1% by weight of compounds of formula (I).

[00054]

Moreover, the compounds of the invention can also be used in different industrial sectors for example to protect wood or as a preserving agent for paints.

[00055]

The invention also extends to the fungicide compositions which contain, in addition to the compounds of formula (I), suitable formulation agents.

[00056]

The compositions of the invention contain in general 1 to 95% by weight of active ingredient.

[00057]

The possible formulations vary as a function of the biological and physico-chemical parameters. They can be for example wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, aqueous solutions, emulsions, solutions for vaporization, dispersions in oil or in water, suspoemulsions, powders, agents for the treatment of seeds, granules, for example microgranules, granules for pulverization, coated granules, absorption granules, granules dispersible in water, ULV formulation, microcapsules, waxes or baits.
