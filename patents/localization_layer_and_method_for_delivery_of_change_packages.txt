BACKGROUND

[0001] Many aspects of human capital management can be computerized to aid both the employees and management carry out tasks in organizations. Over time, some aspects of human capital management change. The changes may occur at different times and for different reasons. In some areas of human capital management, the changes occur with higher frequency than with other areas. One example of an area that changes with relatively high frequency are the laws related to human capital management associated with various countries. Many times a legal change in a country will require a change to the entire instruction set associated with the computerized human capital management task. The changes are generally effectuated by implementing a change in the entire instruction set associated with one or more human capital management tasks. These changes are generally referred to as a patch. Each time a legal patch is made, errors can occur in the instructions associated with a human capital management task. For example, when a software developer changes the instruction set or develops a patch to implement new laws for overtime pay in Germany, the developer may also inadvertently also change the instruction set for overtime pay in China. Patches on a large instruction set may be slow and prone to error. The chance of error is further exacerbated when legal changes for several countries are implemented in one patch. Many countries have laws that take effect on the first of the year. A patch that incorporates changes to an instruction set associated with a task would be prone to error and would take a long time to implement.

[0012] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computing system 100, according to an example embodiment. The computing environment 100 includes a user interface 110, an application program level 120 and a comprehensive integration and application platform layer 130. The comprehensive integration and application platform layer works with an existing infrastructure to enable and manage change. The comprehensive integration and application platform 130 includes a plurality of business applications, known as business components, which reduce the need for custom integration. The comprehensive integration and application platform includes a business component 131, 132, and 133. The comprehensive integration and application platform 130 also includes a business component 200, which includes various integration tools for performing business analysis on business information within the computing environment 100. The application program layer 120 also includes a number of distributed objects 121, 122, 123. The object is a technical representation of a concept that includes data and logic. In one example embodiment, the object, such as object 131, 132, 133 is referred to as a business object and is a technical representation of a business concept that includes data and logic.

[0013] FIG. 2 is a display of a model 200 of a business object, such as business object 121, according to an example embodiment. A business object or object has a structure that includes a root 210, nodes such as nodes 220 and 240, and a sub node 230. Associated with a business or a root 210 is a grouping of information related to the business object root or root 210. Some of the information is held in fields such as 211 and 212. The information is also held in a node 220 which in turn also represents a grouping of information such as data and logic which are held in fields 221 and 222. Also under the root 210 and node 220 is a sub node 230. Sub node 230 holds another grouping of information that includes data and logic that are held in fields 231, 232. The business object 200 also includes another node 240. Node 240 is at the same level as node 220 and includes another grouping of data and logic which includes field 241. Therefore, it is seen that object 200 or business object 200 has a structure which includes a root 210, nodes, such as nodes 230 and 240, and sub nodes, such as sub node 230. It should be noted that FIG. 2 shows a simplified example of the structure of an object or business object 200. In actuality, a business object or object 200 may have a more complex structure. However, the principles as set forth in FIG. 2 will be followed where each root, node and/or sub node includes a grouping of information that can include data and logic.

[0014] In some embodiments, the structure of the business object or an outline of the business object is used to form a model of the business object 200. A model is useful for the purposes of designing and programming in a business object, such as business object 200. A model of the business object 200 shows the structure. In some embodiments, the model is referred to as a template. A template or model can take on any form just so it shows the structure of the object or business object 200. As shown in FIG. 2, the template is formed on a spreadsheet, such as an Excel spreadsheet. Excel is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation.

[0021] FIG. 7 is a schematic of a system 700 including a global business object 730 that includes a root node 731, and a first subnode 733, and a second subnode 734, according to an example embodiment. The subnodes 733 and 734 include information and processes associated with a plurality of geographical locations. The subnode 733 includes a field extension 743 that includes local information specific to a selected geographic location. The field extension 743 supplements semantics existing in the root node 731 and specifically in the first subnode 733. In some example embodiments, the field extensions 743 are referred to as country fields as the field extension 743 includes country specific information. The field extensions 743 is a placeholder in the global business object 730 for extension fields in at least one local geopolitical business object 720 a localization layer. In some embodiments, several local geopolitical business objects 720 may be used to store one or a few country fields or field extensions. In other example embodiments, a field extension or country field 743 is used when the information in the field extension 743 is predicted to change infrequently. The local geopolitical business object 720, in some embodiments, controls the information and process in the field extension 743. The system 700 includes a link 740 between the local geopolitical object 720 and the global business object 730. The link 740 is the assignment of the fields in the local geopolitical business object 720 to the global business object subnode 733 via the placeholder 743, thus establishing the field extension.

[0022] A system includes a core layer including at least one global business object that includes information and processes associated with a plurality of geographical locations, and a localization layer including local geopolitical data structures associated with geographical locations that include information and processes associated with a geographical location. The system also includes a link between local geopolitical data structures and a global business object. In one embodiment, the local geopolitical data structure is a business object. In another embodiment, the local geopolitical data structure is a node. In still another embodiment, the local geopolitical data structure is a field. In a yet another embodiment, the local geopolitical data structure is a combination of one or more business objects, nodes, and fields.

[0023] In operation, the local geopolitical business objects include information and processes that need patches or are changed with higher frequency than the global business objects. It has been found that legal changes occur with higher frequency than other processes. If a legal processes are placed in the local geopolitical business objects then the global business object is not subject to change as often. The local geopolitical business objects can be changed without affecting other local geopolitical business objects. An extensive process which is subject to legal changes is placed in a local geopolitical business object. A less extensive process subject to legal changes is placed in local geopolitical business object as a field extension to a field in the global business object.

[0024] Use of local geopolitical business objects in combination with global business objects is widely applicable. One area is where legal changes occur since legal changes occur with higher frequency than other underlying changes. An example of such an area is in Human Resources Management, and specifically in hiring and paying of personnel. Almost all geographic areas have different laws that apply to employees and many have different reporting requirements. For example, the laws of Germany differ from the laws of the United States. Taxes are different in these different geographical areas. In the United States, the various states also differ from one another since each may have different income tax rates or no income taxes at all. All the information related to an employee and his working relationship with the company are recorded. This information can be placed in a global business object. This information will not change often. The employee will generally be paid at a selected rate. The employee may have a yearly salary and can be paid monthly, bimonthly, weekly, every two weeks, or the like. The global business object will include a process that determines the pay for a selected pay period. This amount will be used by a local geopolitical business object which includes tax rates for income taxes, social taxes, and other taxes. The local geopolitical business object can use the base pay to determine the tax owed by the individual employee. This amount may be withheld by the employee in a paycheck. The process of figuring out the taxes can be housed in the local geopolitical business object as a separate process. In another embodiment, the basic process may be located in the global business object and the tax rates associated with a specific geography may be held as a field extension in a local geopolitical business object. Of course, this is just one example application and many more exist, such as for generating reports for different governmental bodies associated with different geographical areas.
