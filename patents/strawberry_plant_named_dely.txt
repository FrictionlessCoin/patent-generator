[0001] Latin name of the genus and species claimed: Fragaria ananassa Duch.

[0002] Variety denomination: ‘DELY’.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The present invention relates to a new and distinct strawberry variety named ‘DELY’, which was the result of a controlled cross between not released selections of Consorzio Italiano Vivaisti T2-6xA20-17

[0004] The progeny was first asexually propagated by stolons in S. Giuseppe di Comacchio Ferrara Italy in 2004.

[0005] The Dely variety was tested over the next several years in different European areas with continental climates. The test started in 2005 till 2010.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0006] Plants of the new Strawberry variety ‘DELY’ (not patented) can be distinguished from plants of the Strawberry variety ‘CLERY’ by the following unique combination of characteristics described in Table 1:

[0008] Asexual reproduction of this new variety by stolons shows that the foregoing and all other characteristics and distinctions come true to form and are established and transmitted through succeeding propagations. The new cultivar reproduces true to type.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS

[0009] The accompanying photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Strawberry ‘DELY’ showing the colors as true as is reasonably possible with colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color value cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describe the color of ‘DELY’.

[0010] FIG. 1 shows the plant of ‘DELY’;

[0011] FIG. 2 shows the leaves of ‘DELY’;

[0012] FIG. 3 shows the flowers of ‘DELY’ and

[0013] FIG. 4 shows the fruits of ‘DELY’.

[0014] The colors of this illustration may vary with lighting conditions and, therefore, color characteristics of this new variety should be determined with reference to the observations described herein, rather than from these illustrations alone.

DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION

[0015] The following detailed description of the Dely variety, unless otherwise noted, is based on observations taken of plants and fruits, and asexually reproduced progeny, grown at S. Giuseppe di Comacchio Ferrara Italy.

[0016] The observed plants were one year old plants, produced in the nursery in Ferrara in 2009, then stored in cold storage at −1° C. from December 2009 and planted in the production field c/o CIV on 30 Jul. 2010.

[0017] Certain characteristics of this variety may change with changing environmental conditions (e.g., light, temperature, moisture, etc.), nutrient availability, or other factors. Quantified measurements are expressed as an average of measurements taken from a number of individual plants of the new variety. The measurements of any individual plant, or any group of plants, of the new variety may vary from the stated average. Color descriptions and other terminology are used in accordance with their ordinary dictionary descriptions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Color designations are made with reference to The Royal Horticultural Society (R.H.S.) Colour Chart.
