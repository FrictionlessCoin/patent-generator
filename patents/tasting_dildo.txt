FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0001] This invention relates generally to the field of sexual aids and more specifically to a dildo used to collect a woman's fluid from ejaculation created by an orgasm.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0002] Devices for aiding in the pleasure of sexual experiences for both men and women have been in existence for many years. One such device is known as a dildo. This device is typically a penis shaped member than can be inserted into the vagina of a woman, or in some cases, into the anus of a man.

[0003] Many different shapes and sizes of dildos are available in the market today. Some existing dildos have the ability to vibrate and include a vibrating means to increase sexual pleasure and to provide additional sensation for a user.

[0004] Although dildos, including vibrating types, do provide pleasure for their users, there is a deficiency in that there has never been a way to collect fluid from a woman's ejaculation created by an orgasm via a dildo. There also has never been a way to collect a woman's ejaculation or vaginal fluid before or after orgasm by using a dildo. During sexual experiences, it may be desirable to collect a woman's ejaculation before, during, and/or after orgasm for tasting. Collecting a woman's ejaculation from orgasm may provide maximum oral pleasure during sexual experiences. It is thus, desirable to collect a woman's ejaculation from orgasm to increase sexual pleasure and this is an object of the present invention.

[0005] Despite the various apparatus in the prior art, there has heretofore not been provided a suitable and attractive solution to the problem of being able to collect a woman's fluid from before, during or after orgasm. There has also heretofore not been provided a suitable and attractive solution to the problem of being able to collect a woman's fluid during sexual experiences.

[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 6,945,927 (Ritchie et al.) discloses a dildo having a head with two lobes and an external groove/channel that extends from the head partly down or entirely down the length of the shaft of the dildo. This dildo is used for stimulating the upper vaginal wall of a vagina. However, Ritchie et al. do not disclose having reservoirs, specifically reservoirs located on the distal tip or base of the head portion, and is not used for collecting fluid or for tasting the fluid from a woman's ejaculation from orgasm.

[0007] Other prior art references, such as U.S. Pat. No. 6,896,653 (Vail, III et al.) disclose a personal pelvic viewer for a woman and U.S. Pat. No. 4,534,362 (Schumacher et al.) discloses an apparatus that teaches the collection of vaginal fluid to determine fertility. However, these prior art references do not provide for the disclosure of reservoirs located on the distal tip or base of the head portion of a dildo for the collection of a woman's fluid from before, during or after orgasm.

[0008] Therefore it is desirable to provide a dildo which obviates the foregoing and other limitations and disadvantages of prior art dildos, and to provide a dildo for tasting a woman's orgasm to increase the pleasure of sexual experiences.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0009] Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved dildo that allows a user to collect the fluid from a woman's orgasm.

[0010] Another object of the invention is to provide an improved dildo that may collect fluid from two women at a time or from more than one woman.

[0011] Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following descriptions, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.

[0012] Objectives of the invention are achieved by providing a dildo comprising a longitudinal shaft and a head portion, the head portion located at the distal end of the longitudinal shaft, the head portion having one or more reservoirs for collecting fluid.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0040] Advantageous embodiments of the invention are directed to a dildo or vibrator device that allows for a person to taste the fluids created by orgasm of a woman. This is done by having fluid be collected by the device, more specifically at the collection tip, so that it can be tasted.

[0041] In embodiments of the invention, shown in the enclosed FIGS. 1-13, the dildo is designed as a concave tipped distal head. It has a collection tip 130 also known as a reservoir at the top of the dildo, as most clearly shown in FIG. 5. There is an additional collection tip/reservoir at the bottom of the dildo head as shown most clearly in FIG. 6 that allows fluid to be collected as the dildo is removed from a woman's vulva or vagina.

[0042] The reservoir described in this invention has a depth to it and is used to collect fluid. The reservoir or collection tip is more than just a surface indentation and is defined as being a cavity that allows fluid to collect within the reservoir.

[0043] The reservoir may have a certain ratio to the concave tipped distal head whereby the depth of the reservoir extends is one quarter of the total depth of the concave tipped distal head. In other embodiments, the depth of the reservoir may be up to one third the total depth of the concave tipped distal head. In other embodiments, the depth of the reservoir may be less than one quarter of the total depth of the concave tipped distal head.

[0044] In other embodiments, the reservoir may have sufficient depth to collect a suitable amount of female fluid for tasting.

[0045] Other embodiments of the invention involve different shapes for the collection tip or reservoir. The tip can be of a trough form or may have multiple troughs. The collection tip may be made of a sticky material that allows fluid to stick to the tip. The collection tip may have channels that run through it from the top of the collection tip to the bottom of the distal head.

[0046] Other embodiments may involve the distal head having holes so that fluid can be collected.

[0047] The dildo is typically made of a rubber material, although other material can be used. Jelly or other such petroleum products may be used with the dildo. The material used for the dildo is preferably sticky so that fluid can be collected. The dildo can be made of multiple rubbers and other such materials that are insulators and are smooth.

[0048] In other embodiments, the dildo may have multiple heads (such as a two-headed dildo). Functionally, the dildo may be able to vibrate, may be used during male-women intercourse, women-woman intercourse, or male-male intercourse. The device may also be used for orgies or sexual situations where more than two people are involved. The device may also be used for solo use when a female wants to taste her own fluids created by orgasm.

[0049] The vibration of the dildo may be powered by a battery. The battery may be located at the bottom of the dildo as well as inside its mid-section.

[0050] Referring to FIG. 1, dildo 100 is shown having a shaft 110, head portion 120, and end 150, the end 150 being removeable to allow for a battery or power source to be placed within shaft 110, allowing the dildo 100 to vibrate. The battery or power source is not shown.
