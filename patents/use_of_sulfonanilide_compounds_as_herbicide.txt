[0261] The application amount of the active compounds of the invention can be varied in a practically applicable range and basically differs depending on the desired effects. In the case where the compound is used as a herbicide, the application dose is, for example, about 0.0001 to about 4 kg, preferably about 0.001 to about 1 kg of active compound per hectare.

[0303] A solution of 2.30 g 2-bromoaniline (13.37 mmol) in 30 ml of methylene chloride was cooled to a temperature of −65° C. or less. To this, a solution of 1.60 g of tert-butyl hypochlorite (14.07 mmol) in methylene chloride (5 ml) was added dropwise. The resultant was stirred for 10 minutes at a temperature of −65° C. or lower. To the resultant mixture, 2.69 g of 2-methylthiomethyl-4,6-dimethoxytriazine (13.37 mmol) in methylene chloride (10 ml) was added dropwise. The resultant blend was stirred for one hour at a temperature of −65° C. or lower. To the reaction mixture, a solution of 1.76 g of triethylamine (17.38 mmol) in methylene chloride (10 ml) was added dropwise at a temperature of −65° C. or lower. The resultant mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, and stirred until the temperature reached room temperature. To the reaction mixture, water was added. An organic layer was separated with a separation funnel, and an aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride. The organic layer was washed with water again, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under a reduced pressure to give 5.0 g of oily crude product of 2-bromo-6-[(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)(methylthio)methyl]aniline.

[0304] 5.0 g of crude product of 2-bromo-6-[(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)(methylthio)methyl]aniline (13.47 mmol) and 3.20 g of nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (13.47 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (50 ml). To the solution, which was being stirred, 1.02 g of sodium borohydride (26.94 mmol) was gradually added under an ice-cooled condition. The reaction mixture was stirred for one hour at room temperature, and ethyl acetate and ammonia water were added thereto. Insoluble matters were filtered out. The filtrate was separated into an organic layer and an aqueous layer with a separation funnel. The organic layer was washed with water, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under a reduced pressure to give an oily crude product.

[0305] The resultant crude product was purified by column chromatography with a 3:1 mixed solvent of n-hexane and ethyl acetate to give 3.50 g of desired product, 2-bromo-6-[(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)methyl]aniline (yield: 79.9%).

Test Example

[0331] Test of herbicidal effect to weeds and damage on paddy rice in a paddy field: In a greenhouse, each three paddy rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L. cultivar: Nihonbare) were transplanted in each pot filled with paddy field soil. Each twenty forced sprouts of paddy rice (Oryza sativa L. cultivar: Nihonbare) were also inoculated in each pot. Then, any of seeds or tubers of Cyperus difformis L., Echinochloa crus-galli, Scirpus juncoides, SU-resistant Scirpus juncoides, annual broad leaf weeds (including Lindernia procumbens Philcox, Rotala indica Koehne, and Elatine triandra Schk), SU-resistant annual broad leaf weeds, Sagittaria pygmaea Miq, Cyperus serotinus Rottboel was inoculated in the pot and covered with water in about 2 to 3 cm depth. Five days after transplanting paddy rice, prescribed diluted solutions of formulations of the respective active compounds were applied onto the water surface. Each of the formulations was prepared as an emulsion by mixing 1 part by weight of active compound with 5 parts by weight of carrier and 1 part by weight of emulsifier (benzyloxy polyglycol ether). After the treatment, water depth of 3 cm was kept. A herbicidal effect and a herbicidal damage on paddy rice were investigated 3 weeks after the treatment. The herbicidal effect and the herbicidal damage on paddy rice were rated as 100% in the case of complete withering and 0% in the case of no herbicidal effect or no herbicidal damage.
