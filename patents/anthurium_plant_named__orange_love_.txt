Abstract

[00001]

A distinct cultivar of Anthurium plant named `Orange Love`, characterized by its upright, outward arching and freely branching plant habit; medium green leaves that are glossy and cordate in shape; numerous inflorescences that are positioned above the foliage on strong and erect scapes; broad orange spathes with auriculate base; and good post-production longevity.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[00002]

The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Anthurium plant, botanically known as Anthurium andreanum, and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name `Orange Love`.

[00003]

The new Anthurium is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor in Schipluiden, The Netherlands. The objective of the program is to create new Anthurium cultivars that have a freely branching growth habit, strong plant growth, medium leaf size, rapid growth rate, strong roots, attractive spathe color, numerous inflorescences and good post-production longevity. The new cultivar originated from a cross by the inventor in 1992 of the inventor's proprietary Anthurium andreanum selection code number 924 as the female, or seed, parent with the inventor's proprietary Anthurium andreanum selection code number 9322 as the male, or pollen, parent. The cultivar `Orange Love` was discovered and selected by the inventor as a plant within the progeny of the stated cross in a controlled environment in Schipluiden, The Netherlands.

[00004]

Asexual propagation by tissue culture of the new cultivar at Schipluiden, The Netherlands, has shown that the unique features of this new Anthurium plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual propagation.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[00005]

The new Anthurium has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.

[00006]

The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of `Orange Love`. These characteristics in combination distinguish `Orange Love` as a new and distinct cultivar:

[00007]

1. Upright, outwardly arching and freely branching growth habit.

[00008]

2. Medium green leaves that are glossy and cordate in shape.

[00009]

3. Numerous inflorescences that are positioned above the foliage on strong and erect scapes.

[00010]

4. Broad orange spathes with auriculate base.

[00011]

5. Good post-production longevity.

[00012]

The new Anthurium can be compared to its female parent cultivar, the proprietary selection code number 924. Besides differing leaf and spathe shape, plants of the new Anthurium are different from plants of selection code number 924 in the following characteristics:

[00013]

1. Plants of the cultivar `Orange Love` are more compact than plants of the selection code number 924.

[00014]

2. Plants of the cultivar `Orange Love` have smaller leaves than plants of the selection code number 924.

[00015]

3. Spathe color of plants of the cultivar `Orange Love` is orange whereas spathe color of plants of the selection code number 924 is red.

[00016]

The new Anthurium can be compared to its male parent cultivar, the proprietary selection code number 9322. Plants of the new Anthurium are different from plants of selection code number 9322 in the following characteristics:

[00017]

1. Plants of the cultivar `Orange Love` have smaller leaves than plants of the selection code number 9322.

[00018]

2. Plants of the cultivar `Orange Love` differ from plants of the selection code number 9322 in leaf shape and spathe shape.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH

[00019]

The accompanying colored photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new cultivar, showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type.

[00020]

The photograph comprises a top perspective view of a typical potted plant of `Orange Love`. Leaf and flower colors in the photographs may appear different from the actual colors due to light reflectance.

DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION

[00021]

In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe plants grown in Schipluiden, the Netherlands, in a glass greenhouse with an average day temperature of 25° C. and an average night temperature of 19° C.
