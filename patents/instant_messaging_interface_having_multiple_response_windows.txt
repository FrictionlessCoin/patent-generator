BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0001] 1. Field of the Invention

[0002] The present invention generally relates to instant messaging. More specifically, the present invention is directed to an instant messaging interface having multiple response windows.

[0003] 2. Related Art

[0004] In instant messaging systems, a user may be typing a message, and then receive a response from the person with whom the user is corresponding, which may cause the user to want to respond differently, without deleting the response the user was already typing. For example, a user may have been typing a question Q1 when the other person asks the user a question Q2. In this case, the user may wish to respond to the question Q2 before communicating their own question Q1 to the other person.

[0005] One solution for addressing this dilemma is to use the “cut and paste” feature found in many computer operating systems. For example, a user can “cut” and save (e.g., on a “clipboard”) a response the user is currently typing, and then type a new response. Then, the user can retrieve the saved response using “paste” once the new response has been sent. This can be cumbersome, and can result in errors if a user fails to highlight the entire response they were working on.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0006] The present invention is directed to an instant messaging interface having multiple response windows.

[0007] A first aspect of the invention is directed to an instant messaging (IM) interface, comprising: a chat window for displaying a chat between a plurality of IM users; a current response window for displaying response data for inclusion in the chat; a next response window; and a move element for: clearing the response data displayed in the current response window and sending the response data to, and displaying the response data in, the next response window; and sending the response data displayed in the next response window back to the current response window.

[0008] Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for instant messaging, comprising: providing an instant messaging (IM) interface comprising a chat window for displaying a chat between a plurality of IM users, a current response window for displaying response data for inclusion in the chat, a next response window, and a move element; actuating the move element to clear the response data displayed in the current response window and to send the response data to, and display the response data in, the next response window; and actuating the move element to send the response data displayed in the next response window back to the current response window.

[0009] The illustrative aspects of the present invention are designed to solve the problems herein described and other problems not discussed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0014] As described above, the present invention is directed to an instant messaging interface having multiple response windows.

[0015] FIG. 1 depicts an illustrative instant messaging (IM) interface 10 with multiple windows in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The IM interface 10 includes a chat window 12 for displaying an ongoing chat between a plurality of IM users, a current message window 14 in which an IM user 16 can type a response for inclusion in the chat, and a Send button 18 for sending the response from the current message window 14 to the other IM users 20 involved in the chat. The sent response is also displayed in the chat window 12. Other buttons, such as an “Invite Others” button and a Close button, are also provided as part of the IM interface 10.

[0016] In addition to the current message window 14, the IM interface 10 of the present invention includes a next message window 22. During a chat, the IM user 16 can temporarily place (e.g., save) a response that is “in progress” in the current message window 14 into the next message window 22 in response to a move command, thus allowing the IM user 16 to prepare a new response in the current message window 14. To this extent, response data in the current message window 14 is cleared and sent to the next message window 22, where it remains available and viewable to the IM user 16.

[0017] The above process can be performed in response to a move command initiated via a move element in the IM interface 10. In an embodiment, the move element comprises a Move button 24. When the Move button 24 is actuated by the IM user 16, the response data in the current message window 14 is cleared and sent (A1) to the next message window 22. After the IM user 16 has sent (A2) a new response typed into the current message window 14 to the other IM users 20 involved in the chat (e.g., using the Send button 18, hotkey, menu selection, etc.), the IM user 16 can again actuate the Move button 24 to send (A3) the response data that was previously sent to the next message window 22 back to the current message window 14, where it can be further edited by the IM user 16 and/or sent to the other IM users 20 in the chat. The response data can be cleared from the next response window 22 after it is sent back to the current message window 14.

[0018] The response data sent to the next message window 22 can be held in the next message window 22 until needed by the IM user 16. Further, the IM user 16 can edit the response data directly in the next message window 22, before moving the data back into the current message window 14.

[0019] The IM user 16 can actuate the Move button 24 at any time to move the response data that was previously sent to the next message window 22 back to the current message window 14. In this case, response data, if any, in the current message window 14 is deleted and replaced by the response data sent back to the current message window 14 from the next response window 22. The IM user 16 can be provided with a “Yes/No delete” dialog box and/or the like before the response data in the current message window 14 is actually deleted.

[0020] The functionality of the Move button 24 can also be provided using a pair of separate buttons; a first Move button 24A for clearing the response data in the current message window 14 and sending it to the next message window 22; and a second Move button 24B for moving the response data previously sent to the next message window 22 back to the current message window 14. A vertical dotted line in the Move button 24 is used to represent the use of separate Move buttons 24A, 24B. It should also be noted that other techniques, such as the use of hotkey(s), menu selection(s), and/or the like, can be used to initiate the moving processes between the current message window 14 and the next message window 22.

[0021] In another embodiment, the response data in the next message window 22 can be automatically sent to the current message window 14 in response to the sending of a response typed into the current response window 14. Once there, the response data can be further edited by the IM user 16 and/or sent to the other IM users 20 in the chat. Alternatively, the response data (or an edited version thereof) can again be sent to the next message window 22 in response to an actuation of the Move button 24.
