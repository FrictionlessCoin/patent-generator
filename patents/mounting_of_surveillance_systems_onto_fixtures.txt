CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

[0001] This Application claims the benefit of priority of the co-pending U.S. Provisional Utility Patent Application No. 61/584,792, filed Jan. 9, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. Where a definition or use of a term in the incorporated reference 61/584,792 is inconsistent or contrary to the definition of that term provided herein, the definition of that term provided herein applies and the definition of that term in the reference 61/584,792 does not apply.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0002] 1. Field of the Invention

[0003] The present invention relates to mounting of surveillance systems onto fixtures and, more particularly, to mounting of surveillance systems wireless cameras onto preexisting light fixtures, including recessed and track lighting fixtures.

[0004] 2. Description of Related Art

[0005] In general, most conventional surveillance systems with cameras (wired or wireless) are mounted onto rigid structures such as walls or ceiling of a building, which increases installation costs due to power and or video cabling, especially within the retail environment where the surveillance system must be inconspicuous and not interfere with the normally perceived “look and feel” of a business. Further, the camera view orientation and angles are permanently limited to only those views from walls or ceiling onto which the camera is mounted.

[0006] In particular, even surveillance system cameras that use batteries for power require a separate charger to prolong the use and life of the battery, which, in turn, requires a standardized AC power line. The required AC power line for the camera charger increases the operating cost of the camera installations due to the power line wiring and extra equipment, including labor costs. Not only are the power lines required for even the battery powered surveillance system cameras, but also a separate video cable needs to be laid out and concealed to make the battery powered surveillance system cameras installation effective.

[0007] Accordingly, in light of the current state of the art and the drawbacks to current surveillance systems mentioned above, a need exists for a device that would facilitate mounting of a surveillance system with a camera without the complexities of additional power and video cables, permanent alternation of a build structure with which the surveillance systems is to be coupled (such as walls or ceilings), and lower installation costs. Further, a need exists for a device that would facilitate mounting of a surveillance system with a camera that enables adjustments of the surveillance system camera view to a desired orientation even after installation.
