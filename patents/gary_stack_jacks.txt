BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION—FIELD OF INVENTION

[0004] This invention relates to a method and apparatus to allow for a more safe, less expensive and more versatile way of placing materials in an elevated area.

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION

[0005] In standard commercial construction practices as well as residential use industry, has seen many new innovations from heavy equipment down to a simple tool. The heavy equipment used is usually rented for a nominal fee if the company can not afford to purchase which many can not. The equipment is also large and needs to have secondary way of transport. The other way this process has been performed and still is by way of bruit strength.

[0006] Originally, the method was performed by bruit strength or some make shift process allowing to move large amounts of heavy or bulky material to elevated areas. Throughout the years construction has undergone many new advances to make work more safe. Over the years construction industry has also seen many advances in cutting production time.

[0007] The equipment used today to place heavy and bulky material in cumbersome areas is limited by terrain and cost. Not only does the terrain cause issues but having a piece of expensive equipment not working is not cost effective for the construction company. Using bruit strength is not safe for the worker or the company owner's workers compensation insurance. The way material is placed in Cumbersome areas in construction today has a number of disadvantages.

[0008] (a) The expensive equipment used isn't cost effective for the owner of the company renting the equipment.

[0009] (b) The expensive equipment is limited to placement of materials due to rough or un travelable terrain

[0010] (c) The expensive equipment is limited by way of having to be positioned for long periods of time.

[0011] (d) The expensive equipment in most cases need a secondary mode of transport.

[0012] (e) The use of bruit strength by way of a human is not ergonomically correct.

[0013] (f) The use of bruit strength by way of human causes chances for injury to the worker.

[0014] (g) The use of bruit strength by way of human puts the owner of the company at risk for a law suit.

[0015] (h) The use of bruit strength by way of human puts the Government at risk for a worker compensation law suit.

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION—OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES

[0016] Accordingly, besides the objects and advantages of the material holding apparatus described in my above patent, there are many objects and advantages of the present invention are.

[0017] (a) The Gary Stack jacks are in expensive to produce, therefore; making the Gary Stack Jacks cost effective.

[0018] (b) The Gary Stack Jacks are easily placed in the construction area, the terrain has no effect on the Gary Stack Jacks.

[0019] (c) The Gary Stack Jacks are in expensive, therefore; the owner can afford to have them sit in position for long periods amount of time.

[0020] (d) The Gary Stack Jacks are small and very easily transported.

[0021] (e) The Gary Stack Jacks relieve the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material.

[0022] (f) The Gary Stack Jacks relieves the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material, relieving possible injury to employee.

[0023] (g) The Gary Stack Jacks relieves the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material, relieving possible injury to employee, hence fourth; decreasing law suits to company owners.

[0024] (h) The Gary Stack Jacks relieves the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material, relieving possible injury to employee, hence fourth; decreasing worker compensation cases.

[0025] Further objects and advantages are to provide a more cost effective way of placing heavy and bulk materials in construction areas. Furthermore, to create a more safe way to place heavy and bulky materials in a construction area, which in turn should decrease injury and law suits from employees. To add, workers compensation cases should decrease in lieu of not using bruit strength to place heavy and bulky materials in a construction zone.

SUMMARY

[0026] In accordance with the present invention Gary Stack Jacks are comprised of a material holding mechanism, support and raising mechanism and support bracket mechanism.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION —FIGS. 1 AND 2—PREFERRED EMBODIMENT

[0034] A preferred embodiment of the Gary Stack Jacks present invention is illustrated in FIG. 1 (side view) of all embodiments of the Gary Stack Jacks consists of FIG. 2 (1) material holding mechanism FIG. 2 (2) support raising mechanism FIG. 2 (3) support bracket mechanism.

[0035] The material holding mechanism is adhered to the top of the support raising mechanism. The support raising mechanism is adhered to the material holding mechanism and support bracket mechanism. The support bracket mechanism is adhered to the support raising mechanism.

Advantages

[0036] from the description above a number of advantages of my Gary Stack Jacks become evident.

[0037] (a) Gary Stack Jacks is more cost effective, no more renting and or buying expensive equipment for placement of heavy, bulky materials.

[0038] (b) Gary Stack Jacks are more efficient, no more having to have a secondary mode of transportation from each job site

[0039] (c) Gary stack jacks are more cost effective, no more tying up expensive rental equipment on the construction job.

[0040] (d) Gary Stack Jacks relieves the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material.

[0041] (e) Gary Stack Jacks relieves the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material, relieving possible injury to employee.

[0042] (f) Gary Stack Jacks relieves the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material, relieving possible injury to employee, hence fourth; decreasing law suits to company owners.

[0043] (g) Gary Stack Jacks relieves the use of bruit strength by way of handing up heavy and bulky material, relieving possible injury to employee, hence fourth; decreasing worker compensation cases.

CONCLUSION, RAMIFICATIONS, AND SCOPE

[0044] accordingly, the reader will conclude that the Gary Stack Jacks of this is invention is far more superior way to moving and holding materials for the construction industry used today.

[0045] Gary Stack Jacks will help relieve some of the cost of renting and or buying expensive equipment, giving the smaller companies the modalities to compete with the bigger corporate companies.
[0046] Gary Stack Jacks is far more safe then the way material is moved today by bruit strength.
[0047] Gary Stack Jacks are far more cost effective than renting and paying to have expensive equipment moved to the construction site.
[0048] Gary Stack Jacks will relieve some of law suits by way of not using bruit strength.
[0049] Gary Stack jack will relieve some of workers compensation by way of not using bruit strength.

[0050] Although the product described above has many specifics, it does not limit the scope of the invention, but as merely providing illustrations through verbiage as well as drawings of some of patent present embodiments.
