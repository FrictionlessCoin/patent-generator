[0001] Botanical designation: Astilbe chinensis.

[0002] Cultivar denomination: ‘Love and Pride’.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Astilbe, botanically known as Astilbe chinensis and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘Love and Pride’.

[0004] The new Astilbe is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Heemskerk, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program was to create new Astilbe cultivars with healthy foliage and attractive flower coloration.

[0005] The new Astilbe originated from a cross-pollination made by the Inventor in 1998 in Heemskerk, The Netherlands, of two unidentified selections of Astilbe chinensis, not patented. The new Astilbe was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination in a controlled environment in Heemskerk, The Netherlands in July, 1999.

[0006] Asexual reproduction of the new Astilbe by divisions in a controlled environment in Heemskerk, The Netherlands since January, 2000, has shown that the unique features of this new Astilbe are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0007] The cultivar Love and Pride has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment and cultural practices such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype.

[0008] The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Love and Pride’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Love and Pride’ as a new and distinct cultivar of Astilbe:

[0009] 1. Upright and sturdy plant habit.
[0010] 2. Strong and healthy foliage.
[0011] 3. Freely and uniformly flowering habit.
[0012] 4. Red purple-colored flowers.
[0013] 5. Good garden performance.

[0014] Plants of the new Astilbe and the parent selections differ primarily in flower coloration and plant height.

[0015] Plants of the new Astilbe can be compared to plants of the cultivar Finale, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Heemskerk, The Netherlands, plants of the new Astilbe and the cultivar Finale differed in the following characteristics:

[0016] 1. Plants of the new Astilbe were slightly taller than plants of the cultivar Finale.
[0017] 2. Plants of the new Astilbe were sturdier than plants of the cultivar Finale.
[0018] 3. Plants of the new Astilbe flowered earlier than plants of the cultivar Finale.
[0019] 4. Plants of the new Astilbe had brighter red purple-colored flowers than plants of the cultivar Finale.

[0020] Plants of the new Astilbe can also be compared to plants of the cultivar Cattleya, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Heemskerk, The Netherlands, plants of the new Astilbe and the cultivar Cattleya differed in the following characteristics:

[0021] 1. Plants of the new Astilbe were slightly taller than plants of the cultivar Cattleya.
[0022] 2. Leaves of plants of the new Astilbe were pubescent whereas leaves of plants of the cultivar Cattleya were glabrous.
[0023] 3. Plants of the new Astilbe flowered later than plants of the cultivar Cattleya.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS

[0024] The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Astilbe, showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Astilbe.

[0026] The photograph at the top of the second sheet is a close-up view of a typical inflorescence of ‘Love and Pride’.

[0027] The photograph at the bottom of the second sheet is a close-up view of typical flowers of ‘Love and Pride’.

[0028] The photograph on the third sheet is a close-up view of the upper surface of a typical leaf of ‘Love and Pride’.
