Abstract

Currently there is no one source of electronic database information, no internet website dedicated for buyer/agency information of buyers and agents/brokers representing them. This innovative invention will enable an online electronic database for all buyers in the real estate market holding or engaged in exclusive buyer/agency relationship with real estate firms/brokers. At this website, real estate agents/brokers will be able to input new buyer information and identification at any time, to record, verify, update, terminate, (if mutually necessary,) and renew existing buyer/agency contract. The website will automatically indicate, to a verifying agent/broker, if a buyer he/she intends to represent has an existing un-expired or expired buyer/agency agreement with another brokerage/broker.

At the moment, real estate brokers often get into disputes resulting from dishonest buyers who would not disclose existing buyer/agency relationship with another brokerage/broker. This inherent conflict will be minimized, if not totally eliminated, if all agents, brokers, real estate firms and companies start using this website. One agent, for one buyer, at one time.
