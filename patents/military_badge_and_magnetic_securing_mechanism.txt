RELATED APPLICATIONS

[0001] This non-provisional application claims priority to U.S. provisional application 60/773,118, filed on Feb. 14, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully provided herein.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0002] 1. Field of the Invention

[0003] The invention is related to the field of military badges, and in particular, to securing military badges to military uniforms using a magnetic securing mechanism.

[0004] 2. Statement of the Problem

[0005] The standards for military uniforms and dress are regulated by regulatory bodies of the United States military, such as The Institute of Heraldry, the Army Uniform Board, etc. For prior combat uniforms, such as the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) for the United States Army, regulations required that military service members sew on all military insignia, such as the name tag, the unit patch, the military badges, etc. The sew-on items were securely affixed to the uniform, but military service members had to buy one set of military insignia for each of their uniforms. Recently, new combat uniforms, such as the Army Combat Uniform (ACU), were developed to replace the old combat uniforms. Instead of sewing the military insignia on the new combat uniforms, regulations require that the certain insignia be affixed to the uniform with a hook-and-loop system (VELCROÂ®), such as a name tag, a unit patch, etc. The regulations also require that other insignia, such as military badges, use a pin-on mechanism. Examples of military badges for the U.S. Army include a combat infantryman badge, an expert infantryman badge, a combat medical badge, an expert field medical badge, an Army aviator badge, a flight surgeon badge, an aviation badge, an explosive ordinance disposal badge, a glider badge, a parachutist badge, a pathfinder badge, a military freefall parachutist badge, an air assault badge, a ranger tab, a special forces tab, a diver badge, a driver and mechanic badge, a parachute rigger badge, and a physical fitness badge.

[0006] One problem with affixing these military badges to the new combat uniforms with a pin-on mechanism is that the new combat uniforms can be damaged over time. The new combat uniforms are made from a thinner material than prior combat uniforms. The holes created in the uniform by the pin-on badges eventually enlarge due to normal wear and tear. Also, repeatedly removing and re-affixing the badges, such as when the uniform is being laundered, creates additional holes or further enlarges the existing holes in the uniform. The thin material of the new combat uniforms will eventually be destroyed by the pin-on mechanisms. Thus, a new mechanism for affixing military badges to uniforms in a removable fashion is needed.

[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 6,339,866 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,282,760 describe methods of affixing items to clothing in a removable fashion instead of using a pin-on mechanism. In particular, the '760 patent describes using a magnetic mechanism to affix a decorative item, such as jewelry, to a garment. The '760 patent describes a structure that includes a casing adapted to secure the decorative item against a backing so that the decorative item faces away from the garment. The structure also includes a socket on the opposite side of the backing that extends outwardly from the backing towards the garment. The socket facing the garment retains a first magnet. A second magnet is then placed on the inside of a garment. When the first magnet is brought into a close proximity to the second magnet with the garment in between, the magnets are secured to one another to temporarily affix the decorative item to the garment.

[0008] Unfortunately, the '760 patent does not describe using the magnetic mechanism to affix military badges to the new combat uniforms or any military uniform. Also, the magnetic mechanism in the '760 patent has a structure that causes the decorative item to protrude away from the garment. By protruding away from the garment in this manner, the structure of the '760 patent would not work for military badges. In order to receive acceptance from the appropriate regulatory bodies, the military badge would likely have to mimic the appearance of the traditional military badges that use the pin-on mechanisms. The pin-on badges rest substantially flush against the uniform. A military badge utilizing the structure of the '760 patent would not rest flush against the uniform, but would instead protrude outwardly from the uniform which would not likely be accepted by the regulatory bodies of the U.S. military. Thus, a new mechanism for affixing military badges to uniforms is still needed.

SUMMARY OF THE SOLUTION

[0009] The invention helps solve the above problems with an improved military badge and magnetic securing mechanism that allows a military badge to be secured to a military uniform without having to use a pin-on mechanism. In one embodiment of the invention, the military badge is formed to include a ferromagnetic material or another type of material that is attracted to a magnet. The military badge is also formed to include a back surface that is adapted to rest substantially flush against a military uniform. The magnetic securing mechanism includes a magnet structure adapted to be placed inside of the military uniform. When placed inside of the military uniform, the magnet structure is adapted to magnetically attract the ferromagnetic material in the military badge through the fabric of the military uniform to secure the military badge to the outside of the military uniform. The military badge is secured so that the back surface of the military badge is substantially flush against the military uniform.

[0010] The military badge and magnetic securing mechanism described herein provides many advantages. First, the military badge is secured by magnets rather than a pin-on mechanism, which avoids the damage to military uniforms caused by the pin-on mechanism. Military service members may thus wear their military badges without fear of damaging their uniforms. Secondly, the military badge is secured substantially flush to the military uniform. As a result, the appearance of the military badge secured by the magnetic securing mechanism closely resembles the appearance of a military badge secured with a pin-on mechanism. The military badge and magnetic securing mechanism may thus obtain or maintain approval by the regulatory bodies of the U.S. military as an accepted wear for military badges. Third, the magnetic securing mechanism strongly affixes a military badge to a uniform while allowing for quick and easy removal.

[0011] Another embodiment of the invention includes a method of fabricating a military badge and magnetic securing mechanism. The method includes forming a military badge to include a material (e.g., a ferromagnetic material) having a permeability such that it is attracted to a magnet, and to include a back surface adapted to rest substantially flush against a military uniform. The method further includes forming a magnet structure adapted to be placed inside of the military uniform. When the magnetic structure is placed inside of the military uniform, the magnet structure is adapted to magnetically attract the material in the military badge to secure the military badge to the military uniform so that the back surface is substantially flush against the military uniform.

[0012] Another embodiment of the invention includes an alternative method of fabricating a military badge and magnetic securing mechanism. The method includes forming a military badge having a front surface that includes a badge design and having a back surface opposite the front surface. The method further includes adhering a metallic plate to the back surface of the military badge. The method further includes forming a magnet structure adapted to be placed inside of a military uniform. When the magnetic structure is placed inside of the military uniform and the military badge is placed proximate to the magnet structure on the outside of the military uniform, the magnet structure is adapted to magnetically attract the metallic plate through the fabric of the military uniform to secure the military badge to the outside of the military uniform.

[0013] The invention may include other exemplary embodiments described below.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0025] FIG. 1 is a side view of a military badge and pin-on mechanism in the prior art. A traditional military badge 102 has a front surface 103 having a badge design. For instance, a parachutist rigger badge has a particular design representative of that special skill accomplished by a military service member to earn that badge. Military badge 102 also has a back surface 104 having a pin 105 extending outwardly from that surface 104. To secure military badge 102 to a military uniform 110, pin 105 of military badge 102 is pressed through the outside of uniform 110. A clasp 106 is then attached to pin 105 from the inside of uniform 110. When the clasp 105 is attached to pin 105, military badge 102 is secured to uniform 110 so that back surface 104 of military badge 102 rests substantially flush against uniform 110.

[0026] As described in the Background, there are drawbacks to using the pin-on mechanism to secure military badge 102. When pin 105 is pressed through uniform 110, pin 105 creates a hole in uniform 110. The hole created in uniform 110 will eventually enlarge due to normal wear and tear. Also, repeatedly removing and re-affixing military badge 102, such as when uniform 110 is being laundered, creates additional holes or further enlarges the existing holes. The area where military badge 102 or other military badges are affixed to uniform 110 will eventually be destroyed by the pin-on mechanism. These problems are solved herein by an improved military badge and magnetic securing mechanism described below.

[0027] FIGS. 2-10 and the following description depict specific embodiments of the invention to teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the invention. For the purpose of teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects of the invention have been simplified or omitted. Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from these embodiments that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.

[0028] FIG. 2 is a side view of a military badge and magnetic securing mechanism in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. A military badge comprises a decorative item that is displayed on a military uniform to denote a variety of qualifications and accomplishments to military service members, such as for a combat related event or a special skill. For example, a military badge may include a combat infantryman badge, an expert infantryman badge, a combat medical badge, an expert field medical badge, an Army aviator badge, a flight surgeon badge, an aviation badge, an explosive ordinance disposal badge, a glider badge, a parachutist badge, a pathfinder badge, a military freefall parachutist badge, an air assault badge, a ranger tab, a special forces tab, a diver badge, a driver and mechanic badge, a parachute rigger badge, and a physical fitness badge issued by the U.S. Army. Other branches of the U.S. military may have other military badges.

[0029] In FIG. 2, military badge 202 has a front surface 203 having a design designated for that badge. Military badge 202 also has a back surface 204 that is adapted to rest substantially flush against a military uniform 210. Military badge 202 is typically formed substantially or partially from a non-magnetic material, such as brass or zinc. In this embodiment, military badge 202 is also formed from a material, such as a ferromagnetic material, having a permeability such that it is magnetically attracted to a magnet. As a result, military badge 202 has magnetic properties not found in previous military badges.

[0030] To secure military badge 202 to military uniform 210, military badge 202 is placed on a desired area on the outside of uniform 210. A magnetic securing mechanism is then used to secure military badge 202 to the outside of uniform 210. In this embodiment, the magnetic securing mechanism comprises a magnet structure 206 that is adapted to be placed inside of uniform 210 proximate to military badge 202. When military badge 202 is placed proximate to magnet structure 206, magnet structure 206 is adapted to magnetically attract the magnetic material in military badge 202 through the fabric of uniform 210 to secure military badge 202 to the outside of uniform 210. Back surface 204 of military badge 202 rests substantially flush against uniform 210.

[0031] Magnet structure 206 advantageously secures military badge 202 with magnetism rather than using pins, which avoids the damage to uniform 210 that may be caused by a pin-on mechanism. Military badge 202 is also secured substantially flush to uniform 210 which closely mimics the appearance of military badge 102 secured with a pin-on mechanism (see FIG. 1). Military badge 202 and magnet structure 206 may likely obtain or maintain approval by the regulatory bodies of the U.S. military as an accepted wear for military badges. Also, magnet structure 206 strongly affixes military badge 202 to uniform 210 while allowing for quick and easy removal.

[0032] FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a method 300 of fabricating a military badge and magnetic securing mechanism in exemplary embodiment of the invention. Method 300 is described with reference to the military badge and magnetic securing mechanism shown in FIG. 2. In step 302, a military badge 202 is formed or enhanced to include a material (i.e., a magnetic material) having a permeability such that it is magnetically attracted to a magnet. In one example, military badge 202 may be first formed from brass or zinc to have a desired badge design on a front surface 203 and a substantially flat back surface 204. At this point, military badge 202 does not have magnetic properties. A thin metallic plate may then be affixed to back surface 204 of military badge 202, which adds magnetic material to military badge 202 giving badge 202 magnetic properties. In another example, military badge 202 may again be formed from brass or zinc to have a desired badge design on a front surface 203 and a back surface 204 having one or more cavities. A metallic material may then be deposited in the cavities on the back surface 204 of military badge 202 to add magnetic material to military badge 202. In another embodiment, military badge 202 may be formed from brass or zinc, and may also be formed with metallic inserts that gives badge 202 magnetic properties.

[0033] Also in step 302, military badge 202 is formed to include a back surface 204 adapted to rest substantially flush against a military uniform. Back surface 204 is not necessarily flat. However, back surface 204 may be substantially planar to resemble the back surface of a military badge presently approved for wear on a military uniform, such as a military badge having a pin-on mechanism.

[0034] In step 304, a magnet structure 206 is formed that is adapted to be placed inside of military uniform 210. When placed inside of uniform 210, magnet structure 206 is adapted to magnetically attract the material in military badge 202 to secure military badge 202 to the outside of uniform 210. When secured to uniform 210, back surface 204 of military badge 202 is substantially flush against uniform 210 and front surface 203 having the badge design is visible.

[0035] FIGS. 4-9 illustrate a more detailed embodiment of a military badge and magnetic securing mechanism. FIG. 4 is a front view of a military badge 400. Military badge 400 has a front surface 402 that is visible when military badge 400 is secured to a military uniform. Front surface 402 has a badge design in this embodiment for a parachutist rigger, but other designs may be used based on the combat event or special skill represented by badge 400.

[0036] FIG. 5 is a rear view of military badge 400. Military badge 400 has a back surface 502 that faces toward the military uniform. In this embodiment, a metallic strip 504 is adhered to back surface 502. Metallic strip 504 is formed from a material, such as a ferromagnetic material, that has magnetic properties such that it is magnetically attracted to a magnet. Metallic strip 504 may cover only a portion of back surface 502 as shown in FIG. 5, may cover the entirety of back surface 502, or may not be visible due to manufacturing methods described in FIG. 3.

[0037] FIG. 6 is a front view of a magnet structure 602. Magnet structure 602 comprises one or more permanent magnets 604 that are housed in a pliable material 606, such as rubber or plastic. The size and shape of magnet structure 602 corresponds with the size and shape of metallic strip 504 shown in FIG. 5.

[0038] FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating a method 700 of fabricating a military badge and magnetic securing mechanism as described in FIGS. 4-6. In step 702, a military badge 400 is formed having a front surface 402 that includes a badge design and having a back surface 502 opposite the front surface. In step 704, a metallic plate 504 is adhered to back surface 502 of military badge 400. Metallic plate 504 may be glued or otherwise adhered with some type of adhesive. Metallic plate 504 may alternatively adhered to back surface 502 with screws, bolts, or some other type of affixing means. In step 706, a magnet structure 602 is formed, where magnet structure 602 is adapted to be placed inside of a military uniform. As shown in FIG. 6, magnet structure 602 may be formed with one or more permanent magnets 604 housed in a pliable material 606.

[0039] When military badge 400 and magnet structure 602 are formed, military badge 400 may be secured to a military uniform using magnet structure 602. FIG. 8 illustrates a view of an outside of a military uniform 802. Military uniform 802 may comprise a combat uniform such as an Army Combat Uniform (ACU), or may comprise any category or type of military uniform suited for military badges. According to military regulations, military badges are to be worn on specific locations of uniform 802. In this embodiment, military badge 400 is placed on the left chest area of uniform 802. Military badge 400 is placed with front surface 402 facing away from uniform 802 and back surface 502 resting flush on uniform 802. FIG. 9 illustrates a view of an inside of military uniform 802. With uniform 802 opened up to expose the inside of uniform 802, magnet structure 602 may be placed proximate to military badge 400 with the fabric of uniform 802 between magnet structure 602 and military badge 400.

[0040] FIG. 10 is a side view of magnet structure 602 proximate to military badge 400. Military badge 400 is placed on the outside of uniform 802 with front surface 402 facing away from uniform 802. Metallic strip 504 adhered to back surface 502 faces toward uniform 802. Metallic strip 504 is shown in FIG. 10 as protruding outwardly from back surface 502. Metallic strip 504 may be fully or partially countersunk into back surface 502 as is illustrated by the dotted lines in FIG. 10. Alternatively, metallic strip 504 may not be countersunk at all into back surface 502.

[0041] When magnet structure 602 is placed proximate to military badge 400 from the inside of uniform 802, magnets 604 in magnet structure 602 magnetically attract metallic plate 504 that is adhered to military badge 400 through the fabric of uniform 802. As a result, magnet structure 602 strongly secures military badge 400 to the outside of uniform 802. Back surface 502 of military badge 400 rests substantially flush on uniform 802 when secured to uniform 802 by magnet structure 602. Military badge 400 advantageously has the appearance that it is secured with a traditional pin-on mechanism. The military badge 400 and magnetic securing mechanism described in FIGS. 4-10 thus provide an alternative to a traditional pin-on mechanism without the damage to a uniform.
