[0001] Botanical designation: Salvia hybrid.

[0002] Cultivar denomination: ‘ENDLESS LOVE’.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Salvia plant, botanically known as Salvia hybrid and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘Endless Love’.

[0004] The new Salvia plant originated from an open-pollination during the summer of 2006 of Salvia verticillata ‘Purple Rain’, not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with an unknown selection of Salvia, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new Salvia plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated open-pollination grown in a controlled environment in Hummelo, The Netherlands during the summer of 2007.

[0005] Asexual reproduction of the new Salvia plant by softwood cuttings in Hummelo, The Netherlands, since the summer of 2007, has shown that the unique features of this new Salvia plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0006] Plants of the new Salvia have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype.

[0007] The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Endless Love’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Endless Love’ as a new and distinct cultivar of Salvia:

[0008] 1. Compact, upright and outwardly spreading plant habit.
[0009] 2. Strong and vigorous growth habit.
[0010] 3. Freely flowering habit.
[0011] 4. Violet blue-colored flowers.

[0012] Plants of the new Salvia can be compared to plants of the female parent, ‘Purple Rain’. Plants of the new Salvia differ from plants of ‘Purple Rain’ in the following characteristics:

[0013] 1. Plants of the new Salvia are more compact than plants of ‘Purple Rain’.
[0014] 2. Plants of the new Salvia are stronger than plants of ‘Purple Rain’.
[0015] 3. Plants of the new Salvia and ‘Purple Rain’ differ in flower color as plants of ‘Purple Rain’ have purple-colored flowers.

[0016] Plants of the new Salvia can be compared to plants of ‘Rhapsody in Blue’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 15,148. In side-by-side comparisons, plants of the new Salvia differed from plants of ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ in the following characteristics:

[0017] 1. Plants of the new Salvia were more compact than plants of ‘Rhapsody in Blue’.
[0018] 2. Plants of the new Salvia and ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ differed in flower color.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS

[0019] The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Salvia plant, showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the actual colors of the new Salvia plant.

[0020] The photograph on the first sheet comprises a side perspective view of typical flowering plants of ‘Endless Love’ grown in an outdoor nursery.

[0021] The photograph at the top of the second sheet is a close-up view of a typical inflorescence of ‘Endless Love’.

[0022] The photograph at the bottom of the sheet is a close-up view of the upper surface of a typical leaf of ‘Endless Love’.
