TECHNICAL FIELD

[0002] The present invention relates to various novel utilizations of sucralose based on the characteristics of sucralose.

BACKGROUND ART

[0003] Sucrose have been widely used as a sweetener because of its characteristics such as good sweetness, rich (full-bodied) taste, water retentivity, ability to give thickness and the like. In recent years, however, general health-consciousness and orientation to low calorie diet are making consumers avoid sucrose, which can cause obesity and decayed teeth, especially in the area of beverages, desserts and other refreshments where low-calorie products are increasing.

[0004] Thus, various high intense sweeteners have been studied and developed as substitute sweeteners for sucrose. Among the high sweeteners, sucralose, which is 600 times sweeter than sucrose, is attracting attention since it is non-carcinogenic and non-metabolize, i.e., having no calorie.

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION

[0005] The present invention a composition containing sucralose which gives various properties to the composition.

[0006] More specifically, the present invention relates to the compositions having various unique properties listed below, and the applications thereof.

[0007] I. Sweetening compositions

[0008] II. Foods with a masked unpleasant smell and unpleasant taste

[0009] III. Performance food compositions

[0010] IV. Foods with improved flavors

[0011] V. Preservatives and foods with improved quality of taste

[0012] VI. Flavor compositions with improved flavors

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION

[0013] As represented by the formula (I), the sucralose for use in the present invention has a structure similar to sucrose, specifically, the sucrose molecule in which three hydroxy groups at 1 position and 6 position of a fructose residue and 4 position in a glucose residue are substituted by chlorine molecules (4,1′,6′-trichloro-galactosucrose, chemical name: 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-β-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-α-D-garactopyranoside). The sucralose is a no-calorie and non-cariogenic intense sweetener which has good and about 600 times greater sweetness than sucrose (U.K. Patent No. 1543167).

I. Sweetening Composition

[0018] The inventions according to this embodiment was developed based on the findings that combining sucralose with specific saccharides or acids mitigates the rough tastes and lingering sweet aftertastes of the sucralose or other sweeteners and produces the sweetening composition having rich and full-bodied sweetness. Specifically, the present inventions are the sweetening compositions listed below.

[0019] (1) A sweetening composition comprising sucralose and at least one sweet substance selected from the group consisting of fructose, non-reducing disaccharide, sugar alcohol, beet oligosaccharide, licorice extract, stevia extract, rhamnose and thaumatin.

[0020] The above fructose and the like may be used singly in combination with sucralose or in any combination of two or more kinds.

[0021] (2) A sweetening composition comprising sucralose and at least one member selected from the group consisting of gluconic acid, gluconic acid salt, glucono-δ-lactone, gymnemic acid and milk serum mineral.

[0022] The above gluconic acid and the like may be used singly with sucralose or in any combination of two or more kinds. Further, the gluconic acid and the like may be used in any combination with fructose and the like mentioned in (1).

[0023] (3) A sweetening composition comprising sucralose and soybean polysaccharide.

[0024] This sweetening composition includes that which comprises one or more of the fructose and the like of the above (1) and the gluconic acid and the like of the above (2), insofar as it sucralose and soybean polysaccharide.

The Sweetening Composition of (1)

[0025] According to the present invention, by combining sucralose and one or more kinds of fructose, non-reducing disaccharide, sugar alcohol, beet oligosaccharide, licorice extract, stevia, rhamnose and thaumatin (hereinafter referred to as fructose and the like), disadvantages such as rough tastes and lingering sweet aftertastes of sucralose or various sweet substances themselves, lack of full-bodied and rich sweetness can be synergistically improved without losing the functions characteristic of the various sweet substances, and can provide a sweetening composition having good sweetness and useful functions.

(1-1) Sweetening Composition Comprising Fructose and Sucralose

[0026] Fructose is a natural sweetener which is found in fruits, especially in pear, watermelon and the like, and honey and the like. Fructose can be obtained by reducing sucrose and inulin, or by isomerization of glucose with alkali or enzymes at low cost in large quantities. Fructose is 1.3-1.7 times as sweet as sucrose and the sweetest among saccharides. Fructose has a characteristic of becoming sweeter at low temperatures. Its sweetness, however, is clear, light and has little aftertaste, and therefore fructose can not impart rich sweetness when it is required. As mentioned in the above, sucralose also is high in sweetness, but its sweetness is light, lacking a body and richness.

[0027] According to the present invention, combined use of sucralose and fructose can significantly improve the lack of full-bodied and rich sweetness and provide a sweetening composition having high sweetness, good sweetness quality with a body, richness and the advantageous properties of fructose such as resistance to crystallizing and high water retentiveness.

[0028] The sweetening composition of the present invention should comprise at least fructose and sucralose in the composition, and may be in any form such as a powder, granules, a solid and a liquid. The sweetening composition may be a powdery mixture of fructose and sucralose; a mixture prepared by spraying a sucralose solution to a fructose powder; or a mixture prepared by spraying a fructose solution to a sucralose powder. The sweetening composition may be also a mixture prepared by drying a mixture of a fructose solution and a sucralose solution. The method for drying the mixture is not critical, and may be spray drying, drum drying, freeze drying and various other methods.

[0029] The content of fructose and sucralose in the sweetening composition is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected within the range which can produce the effects of the present invention. Specifically, the concentration of sucralose in the food, when served, may be 0.0002% by weight or higher, regardless of the content of fructose. It is presumed that, within the possible concentration range of fructose used as a sweetener, the features of the human gustory sense make fructose taste rich and sweet when it is together with the above-specified amount or more of sucralose in the oral cavity. The amount of sucralose to be added for improving the sweetness of fructose does not have particular higher limit. However, addition of sucralose in a large amount makes the sweetness of sucralose dominant since sucralose itself is an high intense sweetener. Accordingly, sucralose is preferably used in a concentration of 0.00165% by weight or lower of the food. More preferably, a sweetening composition is prepared so that sucralose is contained in the food in a proportion of 0.0005% by weight to 0.0008% by weight.

[0030] The sweetening composition according to the present invention may contain, for example, other sweeteners than sucralose and fructose, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components insofar as they do not deteriorate the effects of the present invention.

[0031] The sweetening composition of the invention can be itself used as a cooking sweetener or table sweetener in place of the sugar commonly used as a sweetener and other sweeteners, and can be also contained in various oral compositions as a sweetener therefor.

[0032] The sweetening composition of the invention has low calories, high sweetness and good full-bodied sweetness quality. The sweetening composition also has characteristics of resistance to crystallization and high water retentiveness. Therefore, the sweetening composition is useful for the food whose sweetness increases its tastiness (deliciousness); the foods which use highly concentrated sweetener and the foods for which moistness is required (kasutera (Castilla cake), sponge cake, yokan (azuki bean jelly) and like confectionary).

[0033] The foods which are the subject of the present invention are not particularly limited insofar as they can use a sweetener. Examples of such foods include the above-mentioned confections and like confectioneries, and wide variety of beverages, cold sweets, processed foods, fishery foods, meat foods and the like.

[0034] The foods which are the subject of the present invention include not only those which at first contain fructose and sucralose as a mixture, but also those of which fructose and sucralose are combined in the mouth when taken. Examples of the latter include soft cream in which fructose (or sucralose) is contained in the cream, and sucralose (fructose) is contained in its toppings and cone cup.

[0035] Considering the effects of the invention, that is, the effect of improving the sweetness quality of fructose, a natural sweetener, by using sucralose in combination, the food composition of the invention includes, for example, the foods which originally contain fructose (fruits, processed fruit products (purees, fruit juices, etc.), honey and its processed foods) with sucralose added.

[0036] The amount of the sweetening composition of the invention used for these oral compositions may be an amount effective in giving a desired sweetness to the oral composition, and is not particularly limited. More specifically, the sweetness is variable depending on the kind of the oral compositions to which the sweetener is applied, other components contained in the composition, individual preference of sweetness and other factors. Thus, the content of the sweetening composition of the invention may be optionally selected within the ordinary skill level in the art so that the desired sweetness can be obtained.

(1-2) Sweetening Composition Comprising Non-Reducing Disaccharide and Sucralose

[0037] The non-reducing disaccharide for use in the invention is not particularly limited insofar as it is a non-reducing disaccharide which can be used for foods. Examples of the non-reducing disaccharide include trehalose, neotrehalose, isotrehalose, sucrose and the like. Among them, trehalose is preferable.

[0038] Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide having 1,1 bonding of two glucose molecules. Trehalose has isomers of α,α-type trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl α-D-glucopyranoside), α,β-type (neotrehalose) and β,β type (isotrehalose). Among them, α,α type trehalose is preferable.

[0039] Having sophisticated sweetness like sugar, trehalose is drawing attention for the following excellent features: (1) non-reducing saccharide which does not cause Maillard reaction; (2) stable to acids and alkalis, resistant to heat decomposition particularly in an acidic condition; (3) resistant to moisture absorption, substantially free from moisture absorption at a relative humidity (RH) 90% or lower; (4) excellent in preventing starch retrogradation; (5) excellent in preventing protein modification caused by freezing, cold storage and drying; (6) having non-cariogenicity, among others.

[0040] However, the sweetness of trehalose is low and about 40 to 45% of sugar. Therefore, 2.5 times as much trehalose as sugar, roughly calculated, is necessary for achieving the same sweetness by using trehalose instead of sugar, which is not cost-effective. In addition, the sweetness of trehalose is relatively clear and lacking a full-body taste. Hence, required is a method for increasing and improving the sweetness of trehalose, while retaining the functions of trehalose.

[0041] The present invention can provide a sweetening composition having little lingering sweet aftertaste but having a body, richness and advantageous properties characteristic of trehalose by combining non-reducing disaccharides, particularly trehalose and sucralose, to improve the low sweetness of trehalose and obtain high sweetness.

[0042] The sweetening composition of the present invention should comprise at least sucralose and a non-reducing disaccharide, particularly trehalose, in the composition, and may be in any form such as a powder, granules, a solid (tablet, pill) and a liquid. The sweetening composition may be a powdery mixture of the non-reducing disaccharide and sucralose; a mixture prepared by spraying a sucralose solution to a non-reducing disaccharide powder; or a mixture prepared by spraying a non-reducing disaccharide solution to a sucralose powder. The sweetening composition may be also a mixture prepared by drying a mixture of a non-reducing disaccharide solution and a sucralose solution. The method for drying the mixture is not critical, and may be spray drying, drum drying, freeze drying and various other methods.

[0043] The content of the non-reducing disaccharide and sucralose in the sweetening composition is not particularly limited, and may be suitably selected within the range which can achieve the effects of the present invention, depending on the kinds of the foods to which the composition is applied. The content of trehalose and sucralose may be, for example, 10 to 10000 parts by weight, preferably 100 to 10000 parts by weight, more preferably 500 to 5000 parts by weight of trehalose, per part by weight of sucralose. However, these amounts is to be suitably selected according to individual preference of sweetness and the types of products to which the sweetener is applied, and are not limited to the above specified ranges.

[0044] The sweetening composition of the invention should comprise at least the above two components, while it may contain, for example, other sweeteners than sucralose and non-reducing disaccharide, flavorss, preservatives, stabilizers and the like unless they lessens the effects of the present invention.

[0045] The sweetening composition of the invention can be used itself as a cooking sweetener or table sweetener in place of sugar and other sweeteners commonly used as sweeteners and also as a sweetener, and can be added to various oral compositions as the sweeteners therefor.

[0046] The sweetening composition of the invention has low calories, high sweetness and highly taste good sweetness which can not be obtained by the non-reducing disaccharide (particularly trehalose) singly or in combination with sugar or other saccharides. Hence, the sweetening composition is particularly useful for the foods in which sweetness increases their tastiness (deliciousness). The sweetening composition is also useful for the oral compositions, particularly foods, in which sweetness increases their tastiness and which require moistness, heat buring color resistance, frozen storage stability, discoloration (browning) resistance, syneresis resistance, starch retrogradation resistance, low calories, non-cariogenicity and the like.

[0047] Such foods are not particularly limited, and preferable examples include citrus juices, vegetable juices and like fruit beverages and vegetable juices, cola drinks, ginger ales, soda waters and like carbonated beverages, sport drinks and like soft drinks, coffee, black tea, maccha (powdered green tea) and like tea-based beverages, cocoa, lactic acid bacteria beverages and like milk beverages and other general beverages; yogurt, jellies, puddings, mousse and like desserts; baked confections and steamed confections including cakes, manju (steamed yeast bun with filling) and like Western confections and Japanese sweets and other confectioneries; ice creams, sherbets and like cold sweets and other ice confectioneries; chewing gums, hard candies, nougat candies, jelly beans and like general confectionss; fruit flavored sauces, chocolate sauce and like sauces; butter cream, raw cream and like creams; strawberry jam, marmalade and like jams; breads including kashi-pan (pastry with fillings and flavors) and the like; sauces used for yakiniku (Japanese- or Korean-style barbecue), yakitori (skewered and grilled chicken), unagi-kabayaki (grilled eel) and the like and tomato ketchup; kamaboko (loaf of pureed, steamed fish) and like surimi-based products, retort pouched foods, pickles, tsukuda-ni (preserved food boiled in soy sauce), food preparations, frozen foods and wide variety of processed farm and aquatic products.

[0048] The amount of the sweetening composition of the invention used for these oral compositions may be an amount effective in giving a desired sweetness to the oral composition, and is not particularly limited. More specifically, the sweetness is variable depending on the kind of oral compositions to which the sweetener is applied, other components contained in the composition, individual preference of sweetness and other factors. Thus, the content of the sweetening composition of the invention may be optionally selected so that the desired sweetness can be provided in the final product within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0049] The sweetening composition of the invention is especially useful as a sweetener for the foods which are heated at a high temperature.

[0050] Favorable examples of such foods include the hard candies for which coloration and caramelization by heating are problematic (possibly problematic), particularly the hard candies whose low-calorie and anti-cariogenic characteristic are important commercial values. For such hard candies are preferably used trehalose as a non-reducing disaccharide. Sugar alcohols may be used in addition to the non-reducing disaccharide. As the sugar alcohol can be used those mentioned in the above. Among them, preferable are maltitol, lactitol and hydrogenated palatinose, and particularly preferable are lactitol and hydrogenated palatinose. These substances may be used singly, or in any combination of two or more kinds.

[0051] The amount of sucralose and non-reducing disaccharide (total amount of sucralose, non-reducing disaccharide and sugar alcohol, when used in combination) added to the hard candies is not particularly limited, and may be 100 to 10000 parts by weight, preferably 1000 to 10000 parts by weight of the non-reducing disaccharide, per part by weight of sucralose. The amount of sucralose to be added to the hard candies is not limited either, and may typically be 0.001 to 0.1% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 0.1% by weight.

[0052] Basically, sucralose is an excellent sweetener which is free from heavy sweetness or rough taste as of sucrose, and has clean, refreshing sweetness. However, sucralose can be used to prepare the hard candies with rich and yet clear, refreshing sweetness by adding the non-reducing disaccharide (or further with sugar alcohol) thereto in an amount within the above-specified range, and the hard candies with high transparency. In particular, the hard candies having very crispy and light eating characteristics can be prepared by using trehalose as the non-reducing disaccharide.

[0053] Such hard candies may be those which comprises the above components as essential ingredients, and may also contain, as other ingredients, food additives which are commonly added to hard candies, for example, flavors (including essential oils) and pigments without any restriction.

[0054] The method for preparing the hard candies is not particularly limited, and may be any of various conventional methods.

The method for drying the mixture is not critical, and may be spray drying, drum drying, freeze drying and various other methods.

[0073] Although the content of sucralose and licorice extract is variable according to the kind of product to which the sweetening composition is applied, usually, the amount of licorice extract to be used is suitably selected from the range of 0.001 to 100 parts by weight, per part by weight of sucralose.

[0074] Although sucralose itself is an excellent sweetener with little rough taste as sodium saccharin and like conventional high intense sweeteners have, and clean, refreshing sweetness, adding the licorice extract within the above-specified range gives to sucralose produces a body with deepness and richness in addition to the refreshing sweetness. The addition of the licorice extract also reduces the lingering sweet aftertaste and gives clear aftertaste, providing a better sweetening composition similar to sucrose. The sweetening composition is useful as a non-cariogenic and low-calorie or no-calorie sweetener due to the properties of sucralose. Further, sucralose contained in the sweetener significantly increases saltiness tendering effect of the licorice extract. Thus, it is useful to enhance the tastiness of foods, particularly for the foods with a relatively high salt content such as miso, soy sauce and like seasonings, pickles, tsukuda-ni and like salt cured products, snacks and like salty confections.

[0075] The sweetening composition according to the present invention may contain, for example, other sweeteners than sucralose and licorice extract, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and like components unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0076] The sweetening composition of the invention can be used itself as a cooking sweetener or table sweetener in place of sugar and other sweeteners commonly used as sweeteners and also as a sweetener to be added to various oral compositions.

[0077] Since the sweetening composition of the invention has the aforementioned various properties, it is useful for the foods in which good sweetness and tastiness based on sweetness or deliciousness based on saltiness tendering effect increase the commercial values of the food, the foods in which low-calorie characteristics and non-cariogenicity are advantageous, and for diet foods.

[0083] Sucralose itself is an excellent sweetener having clean, refreshing sweetness and little rough taste as sodium saccharin and like conventional high intense sweeteners have. The stevia extract and L-rhamnose added within the above-specified range gives a body with deepness and richness to the sucralose, in addition to refreshing sweetness. Further, the combination of the above three components improves the lingering sweet and bitter aftertaste of the stevia extract characteristic of the high intense sweetener, giving an excellent sweetening composition similar to sucrose.

[0084] The sweetening composition according to the present invention may contain, for example, other sweeteners than sucralose, stevia extract and rhamnose, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

The present invention can also provide a low-calorie or no-calorie sweetener. Thus, the present invention can be usefull especially for the foods in which tastiness (sweetness, umami taste, etc.) is required to increase their commercial values, the foods in which low-calorie characteristics is advantageous and diet foods.

[0088] Such foods are not particularly limited, and preferable examples include citrus juices, vegetable juices and like fruit beverages and vegetable juices, cola drinks, ginger ales, soda waters and like carbonated beverages, sport drinks and like soft drinks, coffee, black tea, maccha and like tea-based beverages, cocoa, lactic acid bacteria beverages and like milk beverages and other general beverages; yogurt, jellies, puddings, mousse and like desserts; baked confections and steamed confections including cakes, manju and like Western Western confections and Japanese sweets and other confectioneries; ice creams, sherbets and like cold sweets and other ice confectioneries; chewing gums, hard candies, nougat candies, jelly beans and like general confectionss; fruit flavored sauces, chocolate sauce and like sauces; butter cream, raw cream and like creams; strawberry jam, marmalade and like jams; breads including kashi-pan and the like; sauces used for yakiniku, yakitori, unagi-kabayaki and the like, tomato ketchup and like sauces; kamaboko and like surimi-based products, retort pouched foods, pickles, tsukuda-ni, food preparations, frozen foods and wide variety of processed farm and aquatic products.

[0089] The amount of the sweetening composition of the invention used for these oral compositions may be an amount effective in giving a desired sweetness to the oral composition, and is not particularly limited. More specifically, the sweetness is variable depending on the kind of oral compositions to which the sweetener is applied, other components contained in the composition, individual preference of sweetness and other factors. Thus, the content of the sweetening composition of the invention may be optionally selected within the ordinary skill level in the art so that the desired sweetness can be provided in the final product.

(1-7) Sweetening Composition Comprising Thaumatin and Sucralose

[0090] Thaumatin for use in the present invention is a protein extracted from the fruits of the plant Thaumatococcus danielli BENTH. and an high intense sweetener having a sweetness concentration equivalent to a 6 to 8% aqueous solution of sucrose 2000 to 3000 times as high as sucrose.

[0091] The content of sucralose and thaumatin is variable according to the types of the products to which the sweetening composition is applied, but can be suitably selected from the range of the ratio of sucralose and thaumatin=1000:1 to 50:1, preferably 500:1 to 100:1 (by weight).

[0092] When the ratio of thaumatin to sucralose is too low, the taste quality of sucralose becomes dominant, whereas in case the ratio is too high, the lingering sweet aftertaste derived from thaumatin becomes noticeable. Therefore, either case can not produce sufficient sweetness improving effect. However, these amount ratios are variable according to individual preference of sweetness and the types of products to which the sweetener is applied, and are not limited to the above-specified ranges.

[0093] Furthermore, the sucralose sweetening composition comprising sucralose and thaumatin of the present invention may be the sweetening composition as a whole comprising sucralose and thaumatin, and may be in any form such as a powder, granules, a solid or a liquid. The sweetening composition may be in a single portion, or in two portion.

[0096] According to the sweetening composition of the invention, the sweetness of sucralose itself, that is, cleans and excellent sweetness free from rough taste and lingering sweet aftertaste, can be qualitatively improved in one of five basic taste qualities, sweetness by adding thereto the body (richness, volume feeling) which is scarcely found in sucralose. Therefore, the sweetening composition is particularly useful for the foods in which sweetness increases their tastiness and commercial values.

[0097] The foods which can be the subject of the present invention are not particularly limited, and preferable examples include citrus juices, vegetable juices and like fruit beverages and vegetable juices, cola drinks, ginger ales, soda waters and like carbonated beverages, sport drinks and like soft drinks, coffee, black tea, maccha and like tea-based beverages, cocoa, lactic acid bacteria beverages and like milk beverages and other general beverages; yogurt, jellies, puddings, mousse and like desserts; baked confections and steamed confections including cakes, manju and like Western Western confections and Japanese sweets and other confectioneries; ice creams, sherbets and like cold sweets and other ice confectioneries; chewing gums, hard candies, nougat candies, jelly beans and like general confectiones; fruit flavored saucess, chocolate sauce and like sauces; butter cream, raw cream and like creams; strawberry jam, marmalade and like jams; breads including kashi-pan and the like; sauces used for yakiniku, yakitori, unagi-kabayaki and the like, tomato ketchup and like sauces; kamaboko and like surimi-based products, retort pouched foods, pickles, tsukuda-ni, food preparations, frozen foods and wide variety of processed farm and aquatic products.

[0098] It is necessary to achieve the effects of the present invention that the food comprises sucralose and thaumatin eventually. The timing and order of combining sucralose and thaumatin are not critical. It is not necessary that sucralose and thaumatin are present in the same food. Even in case that sucralose and thaumatin are each contained in different foods, it is only necessary for sucralose and thaumatin to be present together when eaten, for example, in such case that soft cream contains sucralose, while its toppings and cone cups contain thaumatin.

[0099] To achieve the effects of the present invention, the ratio of sucralose to thaumatin, when the food is taken, may be 1000:1 to 50:1, more preferably 500:1 to 100:1 (by weight). In particular, when sucralose and thaumatin are present at this ratio, the taste quality of the food can be improved to be favorable taste quality which suits the features of the food, the inherent taste quality of the food is enhanced and increased, unfavorable taste quality of the food can be diminished, and tastiness of the food can be increased generally.

[0100] In the present invention, the content of sucralose and thaumatin in the food may be suitably adjusted in the final food, and are not particularly limited. For example, when the food is a beverage, the total amount of sucralose and thaumatin may be 0.003 to 0.03 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the beverage contained in the final food, and the ratio of sucralose:thaumatin may be 1000:5 (by weight).

[0101] However, since the optimal concentration of sucralose and thaumatin may vary depending on the desired sweetness, sweetness quality, kinds of the foods and the temperature of the foods when taken, it can be suitably adjusted by a person of skill in the art. For this reason, the concentration of sucralose and thaumatin is not restricted to the above-specified range as far as they are combined at such a ratio that can achieve the effects of the present invention.

[0124] Although sucralose itself is an excellent sweetener with clean, refreshing sweetness and little rough taste as sodium saccharin and like conventional high intense sweeteners have, addition of milk serum mineral thereto in the above-specified range adds a body with deepness and richness to the refreshing sweetness of the sucralose, providing an better sweetening composition similar to sucrose. Additionally, minerals are constituents of the body and are important substances which are responsible for physiological effects and metabolic regulation effects necessary for vital activities. Mineral are also useful as activators of enzymes. As mentioned in the above, since the sweetening composition of the invention contains a relatively large amount of milk serum mineral, it is useful not only as a sweetener which imparts sweetness, but also as a functional additive which supplies substances beneficial to organisms and helps the functions of the organisms.

[0125] The sweetening composition according to the present invention may contain, for example other sweeteners than sucralose and milk serum mineral, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0126] The form of the sweetening composition of the invention are not particularly limited, and may be a solution diluted with water and the like, a powder or granules dried by spray drying or like method, or a tablet prepared by molding these powder and granules.

[0127] The sweetening composition of the invention can be used itself as a cooking sweetener or table sweetener in place of sugar and other sweeteners commonly used as sweeteners and also as a sweetener to be added to various oral compositions.

[0128] On the basis of the above described properties, the sweetening composition of the invention is useful particularly for the foods in which high sweetness and good sweetness quality increase their tastiness, smoothness and commercial values and the foods in which low-calorie characteristics and non-cariogenicity are advantageous, e.g., desserts, sweets and like confections, beverages and like refreshment foods, diabetic foods and diet foods.

[0129] Such foods are not particularly limited, and preferable examples include citrus juices, vegetable juices and like fruit beverages and vegetable juices, cola drinks, ginger ales, soda waters and like carbonated beverages, sport drinks and like soft drinks, coffee, black tea, maccha and like tea-based beverages, cocoa, lactic acid bacteria beverages, whey beverages, milk beverages and other general beverages; yogurt, jellies, puddings, mousse and like desserts; baked confections and steamed confections including cakes, manju and like Western confections and Japanese sweets and other confectioneries; fruit flavored sauces, chocolate sauce and like sauces; butter cream, raw cream and like creams; strawberry jam, marmalade and like jams; ice creams, sherbets and other ice confectioneries; chewing gums, hard candies, nougat candies, jelly beans and like confections; pickles, kamaboko and like processed farm products and aquatic products.

[0130] The amount of the sweetening composition of the invention used for these oral compositions may be an amount effective in giving a desired sweetness to the oral composition, and is not particularly limited. More specifically, the sweetness is variable depending on the kind of oral compositions to which the sweetener is applied, other components contained in the composition, individual preference of sweetness and other factors. Thus, the content of the sweetening composition of the invention may be optionally selected within the ordinary skill level in the art, considering the sweetness in the finla product.

[0131] Sweetening Composition of (3)

[0132] The present invention is characterized by the use of soybean polysaccharide as a physical property improver (anti-moisture agent, anticaking agent, anti-deliquescence agent) and sweetness quality improving agent as a sweetening composition containing sucralose.

[0133] The soybean polysaccharide for use in the present invention is a water-soluble polysaccharide derived from soybeans, and includes, but is not limited to, so-called soybean dietary fiber or water-soluble soybean hemicellulose and the like. The soybean polysaccharide is usually extracted and purified from insoluble dietary fibers which are produced in the course of the preparation of soy protein isolate from soybeans, optionally with sterilization. Alternatively, it is commercially available from FUJI OIL CO., LTD. by the product name SOYA FIVE-S, or from San-Ei Gen F.F.I., Inc. by the product name of Water-Soluble Soybean Polysaccharide SM700.

[0134] The soybean polysaccharide may be preferably applied, for example, to such sweeteners or sweetening compositions that are inherently highly hygroscopic and are prone to degradation and alteration of quality, caking and deliquescence, or such sweeteners or sweetening compositions that are powdery and hard to handle because they can be electrically charged. Examples of such sweeteners include a wide variety of conventional sucrose, low intense sweetener and high intense sweeteners. Among them, sucralose is preferable. The combined use of sucralose and soybean polysaccharide lowers the hygroscopicity of sucralose and prevents caking or deliquescence, thereby stabilizing the quality of the sweetener, improving the sweetness quality of sucralose and providing a better-tasting sweetening composition.

[0135] The present invention is a sweetening composition comprising sucralose and soybean polysaccharide.

[0136] The sweetening composition according to the present invention may contain, for example, other sweeteners than sucralose and soybean polysaccharide, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention. Examples of such components include those which exhibit remarkable effects when used in combination with sucralose, such as the above-mentioned fructose, non-reducing disaccharides, sugar alcohols, beet oligosaccharide, licorice extract, stevia, rhamnose, thaumatin and like various sweeteners, gluconic acid, gluconic acid salts, glucono-δ-lactone, gymnemic acid, milk serum mineral and the like.

[0137] The ratio of the soybean polysaccharide and sucralose to achieve the effects of the present invention may be, but is not limited to, typically soybean polysaccharide:sucralose=1:10 to 200000:1, preferably 1:10 to 10000:1 (by weight).

[0138] The sweetening composition of the invention can be widely used as a sweetener for foods in general, drugs and quasi-drugs taken orally or used in the oral cavity. Preferably, the sweetening composition of the invention is used as a sweetener for foods.

[0139] Such foods to which the sweetening composition can be applied are not particularly limited, and preferable examples include citrus juices, vegetable juices and like fruit beverages and vegetable juices, cola drinks, ginger ales, soda waters and like carbonated beverages, sport drinks and like soft drinks, coffee, black tea, maccha and like tea-based beverages, cocoa, lactic acid bacteria beverages and like milk beverages and other general beverages; yogurt (including drink yogurt, jellies, puddings, mousse and like desserts; baked confections and steamed confections including cakes (including sponge cake), cookies, manju and like Western confections and Japanese sweets and other confectioneries; ice creams, sherbets and like cold sweets and other ice confectioneries; chewing gums, hard candies, nougat candies, jelly beans and like general confections; fruit flavored sauces, chocolate sauce and like sauces; butter cream, raw cream and like creams; strawberry jam, marmalade and like jams; breads including kashi-pan and the like; sauces used for yakiniku, yakitori, unagi-kabayaki and like, tomato ketchup and like sauces; kamaboko and like surimi-based products, frozen pilaf and like processed rice foods, retort pouched foods, pickles, tsukuda-ni, food preparations, frozen foods and wide variety of processed farm and aquatic products.

[0140] The content of soybean polysaccharide and sucralose which are added to foods are not particularly limited, and may be suitably selected depending on the physical properties of the foods and individual preference. For example, soybean polysaccharide may be usually used in an concentration of 0.01 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.05 to 20% by weight, and sucralose in a concentration of 0.0001 to 0.1% by weight. Within these ranges, soybean polysaccharide and sucralose may be suitable used at the aforementioned ratio. Because the sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher, when it is used also as a sweetener to impart sweetness, sucralose may be used in the above concentration or higher, while it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

(1) Foods with Masked Unpleasant Smell, Uses of Sucralose as a Masking Agent for Unpleasant Smells

[0163] According to the present invention, the use of sucralose in combination with docosahexaenoic acid, fish and shellfish, processed flour foods, retort pouched foods, canned products, protein ingredients, collagen, soybean milk, natto, processed vegetable foods, processed meat products, vitamins and like foodstuffs can mitigate or mask the unpleasant smells and unpleasant lingering aftertastes (remaining unpleasantness such as a raw smell) which are noticeable when taken without losing the tastiness of these foodstuffs. The present invention provides the foods with mitigated or masked unpleasant smells derived from various foodstuffs, and the novel uses of sucralose as a masking agent for various unpleasant smells.

(1-1) Food Containing Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)

[0164] Recently, it was found that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and like highly unsaturated fatty acid which are largely contained in fish lower the level of blood cholesterol, prevents thrombotic disease and play important roles in the functions of cerebrum and retina. Thus, these components have been added to foods.

[0165] However, these components have raw smells characteristic of fish and shellfish, whereby the range of their application are limited. Among these raw smells, pungent raw smell can be mitigated by arranging the processing method of the foods. However, the problem of the raw smell remaining after the food is taken, that is, the raw aftertaste occurring after the food is taken stills remains to be solved.

The present invention provides especially the DHA-containing foods in which such raw smells characteristic of DHA occurring when taken are mitigated or alleviated.

[0166] The DHA to which the present invention is directed are polyunsaturated fatty acids having 22 carbon atoms and 6 double bonds, which are largely contained in fish oils and other marine animal fats.

[0167] The DHA-containing foods for which the present invention is to be used widely include the general foods containing DHA. Examples of such foods include those containing DHA as a main ingredient (e.g., DHA-containing tablets and capsules, powdery, granular or liquid health foods or nutrition enrichments), the foods and beverages prepared by artificially adding DHA to other nutrients or food compositions as a nutrition enrichments (for example, health foods, nutrition supplement foods, powdered milk, nutritional supplement beverages, the foods with DHA added to increase their DHA content (for example, processed aquatic products), the foods which inherently contains DHA (for example, processed aquatic products made from Japanese anchovies, chubmackerel, Pacific saury, Japanese jack mackerel and the like as raw materials).

[0168] The above processed aquatic products may be the processed foods produced using fish and shellfish caught in seas, rivers, lakes and the like as raw materials by any processing, regardless of the kinds of the fish and shellfish and the types of processing. Examples of the processed aquatic products include frozen products (frozen products, frozen food), dried products, salt cured products, processed foods with seasoning? (boiled and aged foods with seasoning, seasoned and dried products), fish cakes, canned or bottled products, marinated seafood (kasuzuke: foods marinated in sake lee, misozuke: foods marinated in miso, suzuke: foods marinated in vinegar, etc.), fermented aquatic products (narezushi (fermented sushi), izushi (mussel flesh marinated in vinegar), fish sauces), extract products and like general goods, more specifically, kamaboko, chikuwa (pureed and steamed fish cake), fish ham and fish sausage and like surimi-based products, salted mackerel, salted salmon and like various salted fish and shiokara and like salt cured products, shigure-ni (sweet cooked clams) or ame-ni (food boiled in starch syrup) of small fish, squid, clams and the like or and like preserved foods boiled in soy sauce, smoked foods, marinated seafood, delicacies (for example, konowata (fermented sea cucumber intestines), uruka (salted intestines or roes of sweetfish), shuto (bonito marinated in innards sauce), etc.), canned or bottled fish and shellfish boiled in water, seasoned, marinated in oil, marinated in miso or boiled in soy sauce, seafood-based seasonings such as shottsuru (Japanese fish sauce), ishiru (Japanese fish sauce), nam pla (That fish sauce) and like salted and fermented seafood.

[0169] It is necessary for obtaining the DHA-containing food with masked raw smell of DHA according to the present invention that at least the final product contains sucralose, and the timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either. Thus, sucralose in a solid state, e.g., a powder or granules may be used, or sucralose in a form of a solution may be used.

[0170] The content of sucralose in the DHA-containing food is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected depending on the kinds of food and other conditions within the range which is effective in masking the raw smell of DHA. Usually, the amount of sucralose is suitably selected from 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.01 to 1 parts by weight, per part by weight of DHA contained in the food.

[0171] The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, when it is used also as a sweetener to impart sweetness, sucralose may be used in the above concentration or higher, while it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0172] According to the present invention, the addition of sucralose can significantly mask the raw smell of DHA, particularly remaining raw smell, whereby the foods having enhanced physiological functions and enriched nutrition can be prepared without giving unpleasantness caused by the smell.

[0173] Hence, from a different point of view, the present invention relates to a masking agent for a raw aftertaste of DHA containing sucralose as an active ingredient, and to a method for masking a raw aftertaste of DHA by adding sucralose to an object containing DHA.

[0174] The masking agent of the present invention should contain at least sucralose. The masking agent may also contain, for example, other sweeteners, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0175] The masking agent for unpleasant smells (raw smells) the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution. The masking agent is added in any of these forms to the above-mentioned various foods and beverages at any step of their preparation. The addition of the masking agent can significantly mask the raw aftertaste caused by DHA contained in foods, thereby providing the foods which are high in nutritive value and acceptable for more consumers.

[0176] It is not critical when to add the masking agent. The amount of the masking agent to be added to the foods can be suitably selected based on the aforementioned amount of sucralose to be added to the foods of the present invention.

(1-2) Food Containing a Protein Ingredient

[0177] Milk, egg, soybean, wheat and the like are the everyday foods which contain excellent protein and are consumed broadly. However, these foods have characteristic smells derived from the protein ingredients contained therein. The smells of the protein ingredients sometimes spoil the tastiness of the processed foods and food preparations (including beverages) including the above-mentioned foods. Moreover, the smells disadvantageously limit the use and application range of the foods. For these reasons, various attempts have been made to mask the smell of the protein ingredients derived from the protein contained in these foods or its decomposition products without losing their nutrients.

[0178] The present invention provides a food containing a protein ingredient with reduced and alleviated smell of protein ingredients.

[0179] In the present invention, the protein ingredients widely denote proteins and their decomposition products, and include, but are not limited to, proteins derived from eggs, milk, soybeans, wheat, rice and the like, or their decomposition products. Specific examples of the proteins include, but are not limited to, animal proteins including egg proteins (albumin and like egg yolk proteins, vitellin and like egg white proteins, and their decomposition products), milk proteins (milk serum proteins such as casein or its salt, lactoalbumin, lactoglobulin and like and their decomposition products); and vegetable proteins including glycinin and like soybean protein and their decomposition products, gliadin, glutenin and like wheat proteins and their decomposition products, oryzenin and like rice proteins and their decomposition products.

[0180] The smell of protein ingredient which is the subject of the present invention include the smells derived from the above protein ingredients. Preferably, the present invention is particularly directed to the smells of protein ingredient derived from egg white protein, casein or its salt, milk serum proteins, soybean protein or wheat proteins, and their decomposition products. The salts of casein include sodium salt, calcium salt and the like. Preferable examples of the decomposition products of various proteins include soybean peptide, casein-derived peptide and decomposition products of milk serum proteins.

[0181] The soybean peptide is a peptide derived from soybean protein, and is not particularly limited. Usually, the soybean peptide includes polypeptide having a molecular weight of about 300 to 10000, prepared by hydrolyzing the soybean protein with protease (pepsin, etc.) or a dilute acid (as of hydrochloric acid). Such soybean peptide exhibits the ability to lower the level of blood cholesterol, and has a characteristic smell called soybean smell.

[0182] Casein-derived peptide is a peptide derived from casein which is a main component of milk protein, and is not particularly limited. Specific examples of the casein-derived peptide include casein phosphopeptide (α-CPP, β-CPP) prepared by decomposing casein with trypsin, casein macropeptide prepared by decomposing casein with chymosin, casein decapeptide prepared by decomposing casein with pepsin and the like. Among them, casein phosphopeptide (CPP) has an advantageous function of helping the absorption of calcium and like by preliminary bonding with dissolved calcium to prevent bonding of calcium and dietary fibers and the like which prevents absorption of calcium by intestine. Therefore, casein phosphopeptide (CPP) is used as an ingredient for the foods for specified health use. Casein decapeptide has an ability to lower blood pressure. However, both of them have the characteristic smell called milky smell.

[0183] The foods containing a protein ingredient which are the subject of the present invention widely include the foods containing the preceding proteins and their decomposition products. The food containing a protein ingredient may contain one of the above proteins and their decomposition products, or two or more in any combinations.

[0184] Within the above-specified range, the kinds of the foods are not particularly limited. Examples of the foods include a wide range of carbonated beverages, coffee, soft drinks, milk coffee, milk tea, cocoa and like milk beverages, lactic acid bacteria beverages, nutrition supplement beverages, soybean milk beverages, beverages enrich with calcium and like minerals and like beverages; candies, chewing gums, tablet snacks, gummy candies, dry snacks and like confections, jellies, annin dofu (almond jelly), mousse, yogurt and like dessert foods, cakes, cookies and manju prepared from wheat flour, rice flour and the like Western and Japanese sweets, ice creams, sherbets and like cold sweets and like general refreshment foods; breads; rice-based dishes such as rice cakes, ready-to-eat rice and the like; udon (thick white wheat noodle), ramen, pastas and like noodles; instant soups, potages and like soups and their powdered instant foods; tofu or abura-age (thin or thick fried tofu), ganmodoki (tofu-based fried dish), yuba (soybean curd film) and like tofu processed foods; kinako (roasted soybean powder), soybean flour, soybean meal and like soybean flour products and flour products of wheat flour, rice flour and like and various products prepared from these flour products; creamer (cream for coffee); cheeses, cheese food, butter and like dairy product. The foods which are the subject of the present invention include foods for specified health use.

[0185] It is necessary to obtain the foods with masked smell of protein ingredient of the present invention that at least the final product contains sucralose. The time or order of adding sucralose is not critical. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either. Hence, sucralose in the form of a solid such as a powder and granules may be used, or sucralose in the form of a solution or a suspension may be used.

[0186] The amount of sucralose to be added to the food containing a protein ingredient is not limited insofar as it is effective in masking the unpleasant smell of the protein ingredient, and may be suitably selected depending on the kinds of the foods and the like. Usually, the amount of the sucralose may be suitably selected from 0.0001 to 0.01% by weight, relative to the food. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, when it is used also as a sweetener to impart sweetness, sucralose may be used in the above concentration or higher, while it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0187] According to the present invention, addition of sucralose to foods can significantly mask the smell of protein ingredient derived from the protein contained in the foods without losing vitamins, mineral and like nutrients contained in the foods and nutritive value of the foods, thereby providing agreeable foods having high nutritive value.

[0188] Consequently, from a different point of view, the present invention provides a masking agent for the smell of protein ingredient containing sucralose which is an high intense sweetener as an active ingredient, and the method for masking the smell of protein ingredient in the foods for which the smell of protein ingredient is disadvantageous (can be disadvantageous), the method comprising adding sucralose to, for example, the above-mentioned foods (subjects).

[0189] The masking agent of the present invention should contain at least sucralose, and may contain other sweeteners, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0190] The masking agent for the smell of protein ingredient of the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution. The masking agent in any of these forms is added to the above various foods at any step of their preparation. The addition of such masking agent can significantly mask the smells characteristic of various proteins or their decomposition products contained in foods. Accordingly, the protein ingredients can be added to various foods including desserts and beverages without any restriction owing to the smell of protein ingredients characteristic of various proteins and like ingredients, providing foods and refreshment foods which meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.

[0191] It is not critical when to add the masking agent to the foods. The amount of the masking agent to be added to the foods can be suitably selected on the basis of the above-described amount of sucralose to be added to the foods.

(1-3) Edible Product Containing Collagen

[0192] Collagen has been conventionally used as gelatin for various processed foods, as well as for a wide range of applications including edible package materials of foods, cosmetic bases and like biomaterials. Since collagen is the chief constituent of corium and connective tissues, its cosmetic effects have been attracting attention and many collagen-containing foods have been developed. However, collagen has an unpleasant smell and an unpleasant taste characteristic of collagen as gelatin. Thus, collagen added to foods may spoil the tastiness of the foods themselves, and its unpleasant smell and characteristic taste disadvantageously limit the range of use and application of collagen.

[0193] The present invention provides an edible product containing collagen whose unpleasant smell characteristic of collagen is mitigated and alleviated.

[0194] The present invention is directed to a wide variation of edible products containing collagen which are taken or possibly taken orally, for example, foods, oral drugs or quasi-drugs, lipsticks, lip balms and like products which do not cause problems if they get in the mount.

[0195] Specific examples of the products include, but are not limited to, the foods including fruit beverages, tea-based beverages, coffee beverages, soft drinks, powdered beverages, milk beverages, lactic acid bacteria beverages, carbonated beverages, nutrition supplement beverages and like beverages; candies, chewing gums, tablet snacks, gummy candies, dry snakcs and like confections, jellies, annin dofu, mousse, yogurt and like dessert foods, cakes, cookies or manju and like Western and Japanese sweets, ice creams, sherbets and like cold sweets and like general refreshment foods; rice cakes, ready-to-eat rice and like rice-based dishes; udon, ramen, pastas and like noodles; instant soups, potage and like soups and their powdered instant foods; ketchup, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, tonkatsu sauce, dressings, tartar sauce and like sauces and seasonings; collagen casings, sausages produced by using the casings and like foods: medical capsule bases using collagen and capsules having the bases and like drugs: lipsticks, lip balm and like quasi-drugs and cosmetics containing collagen.

[0196] It is necessary to prepare the edible product with masked collagen smell or unpleasant taste of collagen according to the present invention that at least the final product contains sucralose. The timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. The method for adding sucralose is not particularly limited either, and sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution.

[0197] The amount of sucralose to be added to the edible product containing collagen is not particularly limited insofar as it is effective in masking the collagen smell or unpleasant taste of collagen. The amount may be suitably selected depending on the kinds of the subject product and the like. Although not restricted, the amount of sucralose may be suitably selected from the following ranges. For example, a product containing 3% by weight of collagen may contain 0.0001 to 0.05% by weight, preferably 0.0001 to 0.01% by weight of sucralose, based on 100% by weight of the food. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, when it is used also as a sweetener to impart sweetness, sucralose may be used in the above concentration or higher, while it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0198] According to the present invention, collagen smell and unpleasant taste of collagen characteristic of collagen can be significantly masked by addition of sucralose without spoiling the tastiness of foods and aroma of products, and products good for health and cosmetic can be provided.

[0199] From a different point of view, the present invention a masking agent for a collagen smell or an unpleasant taste of collagen containing sucralose as an active ingredient, and a method for masking a collagen smell or unpleasant taste of collagen by adding sucralose to an edible product containing collagen (subject) for which the smell and unpleasant taste derived from collagen are disadvantageous (or can be disadvantageous).

[0200] The masking agent of the present invention should contain at least sucralose, and may also contain, for example, other sweeteners, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0201] The masking agent of the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution. The masking agent in any of these forms is added to the above various products at any step of their preparation. The subject of such masking agent is not particularly limited insofar as it contains collagen. Preferable subject includes that which collagen smell or taste characteristic of collagen affect its product value, for example, the above-mentioned foods, drugs, quasi-drugs, lotions, emulsions, foundations and like cosmetics.

[0202] It is not critical when to add the masking agent to the subject. The amount of the masking agent to be added to various products may be suitably selected on the basis of the amount of the sucralose to be added to the above edible product containing collagen of the present invention.

(1-4) Soybean Milk Food

[0203] Soybean milk has been attracting attention as a food which comprises soybean protein as a main constituent and is high in nutritive value and nutrients. However, its bean smell is raised as one of its disadvantages. Various attempts for alleviating the smell have been conducted, for example, heating soybean milk to deactivate lipoxygenase therein, physico-chemical treatment, microbiological treatment, adding flavors, lactic acid bacteria and the like, development of lipoxygenase-deficient soybean, etc.

[0204] The present invention provides a soybean milk food with mitigated and alleviated unpleasant smell characteristic of soybean milk.

[0205] The soybean milk food which is the subject of the present invention broadly include soybean milk and like soybean milk products and the general foods prepared by processing soybean milk. Examples of the soybean milk products include soybean milk, modified soybean milk, soybean milk beverages, soybean protein beverages and the like. Examples of the processed soybean milk foods include atsu-age, ganmodoki, yuba, tofu and like processed tofu products (e.g., tofu kamaboko, tofu chikuwa, tofu jellies, etc.).

[0206] It is necessary to prepare the soybean milk food with a mitigated bean smell according to the present invention that the food contains sucralose eventually. The timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either, and sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution.

[0207] The amount of sucralose to be added to the soybean milk food is not particularly limited insofar as it is effective in masking the bean smell characteristic of beans, and may be suitably selected depending on the kinds of the applied foods and other conditions. Although not restricted, the amount of sucralose may be suitably selected from the following ranges. For example, soybean milk may contain 0.00001 to 0.1% by weight, preferably 0.0001 to 0.1% by weight of sucralose. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted considering the overall taste balance of the produced product.

[0208] The present invention can provide the soybean milk food whose leafy smell, fishy smell, hay smell and like soybean milk smells characteristic of soybean milk or flavors characteristic of soybeans (bean smell) are significantly inhibited, mitigated and alleviated by adding sucralose.

(1-5) Natto Food

[0213] Natto is a food which has soybean protein as a main component and attracts attention for its high nutritive value and rich nutrients. Because of its characteristic flavor and taste (referred to as natto smell in the present invention), it is consumed mainly in limited regions of eastern and northern part of Japan. Therefore, various attempts have been conducted to reduce the characteristic natto smell, for example, improvement of natto bacillus itself.

[0214] The present invention provides a natto food with mitigated and alleviated unpleasant smell (natto smell) characteristic of natto.

[0215] The natto foods which are the subject of the present invention broadly include natto itself, food containing natto (natto-containing foods) and the general foods prepared using natto as a material (processed natto foods). Natto are classified into itohiki-natto (soft, sticky natto) and tera-natto (firm, unsticky natto) according to their preparation methods and constituents, both of which are included by the present invention. Examples of the natto-containing foods and processed natto foods include, but are not limited to, natto-duke (food steeped in natto-based mixture), natto-soba (buckwheat noodles in natto-based sauce), natto-jiru (natto soup), natto bread, dried natto, natto-ae (food mixed with natto-based sauce), natto-yaki (fried tofu with natto stuffing) and the like.

[0216] It is necessary to prepare the natto food with a mitigated natto smell according to the present invention that the food contains sucralose eventually. The timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. For example, sucralose may be added to the raw material, soybeans, to the natto after being fermented, or to natto product itself. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either, and sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in lip form of a solution, depending on the stage of the preparation.

[0217] The amount of sucralose to be added to the natto food is not particularly limited insofar as it is effective in masking the smell characteristic of natto, and may be suitably selected depending on the kinds of the subject natto foods and other conditions.

However, some of the materials of the container (pouch) or retort sterilizing of these retort pouched foods produce a retort pouch odor which may spoil the tastiness of the foods and give unpleasantness to consumers. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop an odorless pouch and to mask the retort pouch odor of these retort pouched foods.

[0283] The present invention provides a retort pouched food with mitigated and alleviated unpleasant smell (retort pouch odor) characteristic of the retort pouched food.

[0284] The present invention is directed to any food referred to as retort food or retort-pouch food, regardless of their kinds. The retort pouched food include the foods prepared by placing a food in a bag or molded container produced using a light-intercepting plastic film with an aluminium foil laminated thereon or a transparent plastic film with low oxygen permeability and the like, heat-sealing the bag or container and retort-sterilizing the food and can be distributed as room-temperature products (the foods which are pressure- and heat-sterilized in containers).

[0285] Examples of the major retort pouched foods include curry, curry with rice, hayashi (hashed beef stew) and hayashi with rice, stew, gyudon (beef and onion stew on a bowl of rice), seasoning mix for donburi (rise-based dishes served in a bowl) such as chuka-don (pork and vegetable stew on a bowl of rice), oyako-don (fried chicken and egg on a bowl of rice) and like donburi and these donburi with rice, oden (fish cake stew), stewed food, shao-mai, meat sauce, consomme, potage, soups and like ready-made meals; meat sauce, white sauce and like sauce mix, mix for ma po tofu (tofu stewed in meat sauce), mix for kamameshi (Japanese pilaf cooked in a small pot) and like seasoning materials; Hamburg steaks, meatballs and like processed meat products; fish cooked in soy sauce and like aquatic foods; plain steamed rice, sekihan (rice boiled with red beans), gomoku-meshi (Japanese pilaf), fried rice, pilaf, porridge and like rice-based dishes.

[0286] It is necessary to prepare the food with a masked retort pouch odor according to the present invention that at least the final product contains sucralose. The timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. Preferably, sucralose is added to the food before it is placed in a container and retort-sterilized, in the same manner as seasonings. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either, and sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution.

[0287] The amount of sucralose to be added to the retort pouched food is not particularly limited insofar as it is effective in masking the unpleasant smell (retort pouch odor) characteristic of retort pouch foods, and may be suitably selected depending on the kinds of the applied foods, the kinds of the used pouches and other conditions. Although not restricted, the amount of sucralose may be suitably selected from the following ranges. For example, a food may contain 0.0001 to 0.1% by weight of sucralose. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, when it is used also as a sweetener to impart sweetness, sucralose may be used in the above concentration or higher, while it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0288] According to the present invention, the retort pouch odor characteristic of retort pouched foods can be significantly masked by adding sucralose, whereby a food which does not give unpleasantness to consumers can be prepared without losing the tastiness of the retort pouched foods.

[0289] Thus, from a different point of view, the present invention provides a masking agent for a retort pouch odor using sucralose as an active ingredient, and a method for masking the retort pouch odor by adding sucralose to a retort pouch food (subject) for which the retort pouch odor is disadvantageous (or can be disadvantageous).

[0290] The masking agent of the present invention should contain at least sucralose, and may also contain, for example, other sweeteners, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0291] The masking agent for the retort pouch odor of the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution. The masking agent in any of these forms is added to the above retort pouched foods at any step of their preparation. The addition of such masking agent can significantly mask the retort pouch odor caused by their preparation and storage, thereby enlarging the application range and the variety of the retort pouched foods. In addition, this enables the preparation of the retort pouched foods which are accepted by more consumers as convenience foods.

[0292] The timing of the addition of the masking agent to the retort pouched food is not particularly limited. The amount of the masking agent to be added to the food can be suitably selected based on the above-mentioned amount of sucralose to be added to the retort pouched food of the present invention.

(1-12) Canned Product, Canned Food

[0293] Currently, canned products of almost every kind of food are sold, such as mizu-ni (food boiled in water), foods boiled in salt water, foods steeped in oil, seasoned foods, foods steeped in tomato sauce, cooked foods, canned soups, canned sauces, canned rice-based dishes, canned smoked fish, among many other kinds of foods. Further, many kinds of beverages are available as canned beverages contained in the cans made of tin plates, aluminum, TFS and like. However, these canned products and canned foods are sometimes given a metallic odor and can odor when they are stored for a long period or at relatively high temperatures. These odors spoil the tastiness of the canned products and canned foods and give unpleasantness to consumers. Therefore, various attempts have been made to mask the can odor of these canned products and canned foods.

[0294] The present invention provides a canned product or canned food with mitigated and alleviated unpleasant smell (can odor) characteristic of the canned products and canned foods.

[0295] The present invention is directed to any canned products and canned foods of any kind (farm products, dairy product, aquatic products, beverages) in the cans made of any materials such as such as tin plate, aluminum, TFS and the like.

[0296] Examples of the canned products and canned foods include various foods such as canned fruit products and like foods in syrups, canned tuna, canned sardine and like oil marinated foods, vegetable mizu-ni and like water-boiled foods, foods in tomato sauce, jam and like canned products, foods boiled in salt water, canned ready-made foods, plane steamed rice, sekihan and like canned rice products and like, fruit beverages, coffee beverages, black tea beverages, tea-based beverages, soft drinks, milk beverages, lactic acid bacteria beverages, nutrition supplement beverages, soybean milk beverages, sport beverages, beer, chu-hai (cocktails based on liquors made from sweet potato or rice) and like alcoholic beverages and like various beverages.

[0297] It is necessary to prepare the food with a masked can odor according to the present invention that at least the final product contains sucralose. The timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. Preferably, sucralose is added to the food before it is placed in a can, in the same manner as seasonings. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either, and sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution.

[0298] The amount of sucralose to be added to the food is not particularly limited insofar as it is effective in masking the unpleasant smell (can odor) characteristic of canned products, and may be suitably selected depending on the kinds of the applied foods, the kinds of the materials used for the cans and other conditions. Although not restricted, the amount of sucralose may be suitably selected from the following ranges. For example, a food may contain 0.0005 to 0.1% by weight of sucralose. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, when it is used also as a sweetener to impart sweetness, sucralose may be used in the above concentration or higher, while it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0299] According to the present invention, the can odor characteristic of canned products can be significantly masked by adding sucralose, whereby a food which does not give unpleasantness to consumers can be prepared without losing the tastiness of the canned products and canned foods.

[0300] Thus, from a different point of view, the present invention provides a masking agent for a can smell using sucralose as an active ingredient, and a method for masking the can smell by adding sucralose to a canned product or a canned food for which the can smell is disadvantageous (or can be disadvantageous).

[0301] The masking agent of the present invention should contain at least sucralose, and may also contain, for example, other sweeteners, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0302] The masking agent for a can smell of the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution. The masking agent in any of these forms is added to the above canned products and canned foods at any step of their preparation. The addition of such masking agent can significantly mask the metallic can smell caused by their preparation and storage, thereby providing the canned product or canned food which are accepted and preferred by more consumers as a convenience food.

[0303] The timing of the addition of the masking agent to the food is not particularly limited. The amount of the masking agent to be added to the food can be suitably selected based on the above-mentioned amount of sucralose to be added to the food of the present invention.

(2) Food with Masked Unpleasant Taste, Use of Sucralose as Masking Agent for Unpleasant Taste

[0304] According to the present invention, using sucralose in combination with various galenical, amino acid or peptide, collagen, vitamin and like foodstuffs can mitigate or mask the unpleasant taste (bitter taste, astringent taste, etc.) which are felt when taking these foodstuffs without impairing the inherent functions of these foodstuffs. The present invention provides a food with reduced and masked unpleasant taste derived from the above foodstuff, and a novel use of sucralose as a masking agent for various unpleasant tastes. The description of the masking agent for the smell of collagen and vitamin and the method for masking the smell of collagen and vitamins are as mentioned in the above.

(2-1) Galenical-Containing Composition

[0305] Chinese medicine formulations have been used since ancient times. Although Western medicine has now become mainstream, Chinese medicine formulations tend to be preferred for older people, children, pregnant women and like people because of the possible side effects of chemical preparations. However, many of the galenical which are the components of Chinese medicine formulations have harsh tastes including a bitter taste. Therefore, the Chinese medicine formulations containing various galenicals have characteristic mixed unpleasant tastes such as bitter taste, astringent taste, raw smell, sour taste and the like produced by the galenicals. These unpleasant tastes lead to considerably unpleasant swallowing feeling which induces poor compliance and failure in producing the desired therapeutic effects even the formulations have excellent pharmaceutical effects. Usually in case of oral preparations, sucrose and like sweeteners or taste developers are added to the formulation, or they are prepared as capsules or sugar-coated tablets to mask the unpleasant smell of the medicines. However, the former method requires a large amount of sucrose to reduce the bitterness and involves the disadvantages of unpleasant aftertaste and excessive intake of sugar. Further, the latter method is not suitable for aged people and children with poor swallowing ability.

[0306] The present invention provides a galenical-containing composition with mitigated and alleviated unpleasant smell characteristic of Chinese medical formulations (hereinafter referred to as galenicals).

[0307] The present invention is directed to the galenicals including mallotus bark, gambir aloe, benzoin, artemisia capillaris flower, fennel, bearberry leaf, rose fruit, corydalis tuber, sctellaria root, phellodendron bark, coptis rhizome, polygala root, zedoary, Japanese valerian, trichosanthes root, platycodon root, catalpa fruit, immature orange, apricot kernel, sophora root, cinnamon bark, cassia seed, pharbitis seed, gentian, geranium herb, safflower, red ginseng, cyperus rhizome, magnolia bark, oriental bezoar, evodia fruit, schisandra fruit, calumba, condurango, bupleurum root, asiasarum root, saffron, gardenia fruit, cornus fruit, zanthoxylum fruit, rehmannia root, digitalis, peony root, plantago seed, amomum seed, ginger, cardamon, cimicifuga rhizome, senega, cnidium rhizome, nuphar rhizome, toad venom, senna leaf, swertia herb, atractylodes lancea rhizome, mulberry bark, perilla herb, rhubarb, alisma rhizome, panax rhizome, anemarrhena rhizome, clove, citrus unshiu peel, capsicum, Japanese angelica root, peach kernel, bitter orange peel, ipecac, picrasma wood, pinellia tuber, angelica dahurica root, atractylodes rhizome, areca, belladonna root, sinomenium stem, moutan bark, nux vomica, ephedra herb, digenea, akebia stem, saussurea root, bitter cardamon, bear bile, Japanese Gentian, ipecacscopolia rhizome, Turmeric, smoked plum, Lindera strychnifolia, isodonis herba, Polygonatum falcatum, Pruni cortex, mugwort (japanese), Chinese wax-gourd seed, Polygonum multiflorum, patchouli leaf, German chamomile, Trichosanthis Semen, Chrysanthemum morifolium, Citrus aurantium, notopterygium, Japanese notopterygium, jin yin, Chinese matrimony vine seed, Chinese matrimony vine leaf, Scrophularia ningpoensis, Ligustici Chinensis, burdock seed, hawthorn, cornus fruit, Sophora subprostrata, rehmannia root powder, Aster tataricus Linne fil., Tribulus terrestris, magnolia flower, TurmericAcorus gramineus, Qian Hu(Peucedanum Root), Arisaema serratum, Asparagus root, pubescent angelica, Heavenly-bamboo fruit, nutmeg, ginseng powder, Japanese honeysuckle, Fritillaria thunbergii mig., Carica papaya L., motherwort, smoked plumbayberry bark, and the like.

[0308] The galenical-containing composition of the present invention may contain one of the above galenicals singly, or two or more in any combinations. The composition may also contain, for example, other galenicals which do not have bitter tastes or like unpleasant tastes as other components.

[0309] Examples of the combinations of the galenicals are those recognized as common Chinese medicine formulations, and include, but are not limited to, Ge Gen Tang, Chai Hu Gui Zhi Tang, Xiang Zheng Qi San, Xiang Sheng Po Di Wan, Xiang Su San, Xiao Chai Hu Tang, among others.

[0310] These formulations may be in any form such as powders, granules, extracts, liquids, syrups and the like.

[0311] The amount of the galenicals contained in these galenical-containing compositions is not limited, and may be that normally added as drugs (Chinese medicine).

[0312] It is necessary to prepare the galenical-containing composition with masked unpleasant taste according to the present invention that the composition contains sucralose eventually. The timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either, and sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution and suspension.

[0313] The amount of sucralose to be added to the galenical-containing composition is not particularly limited insofar as it is effective in masking the unpleasant taste (bitterness, etc.) derived from various galenicals. The amount may be suitably selected depending on the kind and amount of the galenicals contained in the composition and forms of the subject compositions. Although not restricted, the amount of sucralose may be suitably selected from, for example, 0.001 to 0.01% by weight, preferably 0.0025 to 0.005% by weight, based on the galenical-containing composition, considering the balance of the flavor and taste of the oral composition itself. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, sucralose may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0314] According to the present invention, the unpleasant taste derived from galenicals can be significantly masked by adding sucralose, and a drug with an improved flavor, taste and swallowing feeling can be prepared.

[0315] From a different point of view, the present invention provides a masking agent for the unpleasant taste derived from galenicals using sucralose as an active component and a method for masking the unpleasant taste of galenicals by adding sucralose to a galenical-containing composition (subject) for which the unpleasant taste derived from galenicals is disadvantageous (or can be disadvantageous).

[0316] The masking agent of the present invention should contain at least sucralose, and may also contain, for example, other sweeteners, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0317] The masking agent of the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution. The masking agent in any of these forms is added to the above oral composition at any step of their preparation. The addition of such masking agent can significantly mitigate and mask the smell of the unpleasant taste derived from various galenicals of the galenical-containing composition.

[0318] The timing of the addition of the masking agent to the galenical-containing composition is not particularly limited. The amount of the masking agent to be added to the composition can be suitably selected based on the above-mentioned amount of sucralose to be added to the composition.

(2-2) Oral Composition Containing Amino Acid/Peptide

[0319] Conventionally, to supply amino acids which are necessary for the foods of humans and animals, various amino acids and peptides have been used and studied as enrichments. However, some amino acids and peptides have bitter tastes which disadvantageously limit the kind and amount of the amino acids and peptides to be used in spite of their effectiveness in improving health and their other advantages when added to foods, drugs, quasi-drugs and the like. Therefore, various attempts have been conducted to reduce the bitter taste characteristic of the amino acids and peptides so that they can be used in wider variety.

[0320] The present invention provides an oral composition containing amino acids and peptides with mitigated and alleviated unpleasant taste characteristic of the amino acids and peptides.

[0321] The present invention is directed to the oral composition which contains amino acids or peptides, can be orally taken or used in the oral cavity and have a bitter taste, and may be any kind of foods, foods for specified health use and drugs and quasi-drugs. Examples of the oral composition include not only those which can be taken orally such as foods, oral drugs and quasi-drugs, but also ointments and like drugs for the oral cavity and those which are possibly taken orally such as lip balms and like quasi-drugs.

[0322] The kind of the amino acids and peptides are not particularly limited insofar as they themselves have bitter tastes. It is known that the bitter taste of an amino acid increases when the molecular weight of the amino acid increases. For example, valine has sweet and bitter taste (weak taste), while leucine, methionine, hystidine, phenylalanine and tryptophan have bitter tastes (slight taste) and isoleucine has a relatively strong bitter taste.

[0323] The bitter taste of the peptides can be derived from their constituents, amino acids, and the oligopeptide having one or more of the above valine, leucine, methionine, hystidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan or leucineisoleucine tends to have a bitter taste.

[0324] Examples of the bitter-tasting peptides include soybean peptide, wheat peptide, casein-derived peptide, milk serum peptide, egg white peptide, plasma peptide and the like.

[0325] Herein, the soybean peptide is not particularly limited insofar as it is a peptide derived from soybean protein, including the polypeptide which is typically prepared by decomposing the soybean protein with protease (such as pepsin), a dilute hydrochloric acid or like acids and having a molecular weight of about 300 to 20000. Such soybean peptide is useful as a foodstuff because of its physical properties and effective in lowering serum cholesterol. However, the soybean peptide has a characteristic odor called a soybean odor.

[0326] The casein-derived peptide in the present invention is not particularly limited insofar as it is a peptide derived from casein which is a main constituent of milk protein. Examples of the casein-derived peptide include casein phosphopeptide (α-CPP, ?-CPP) which is prepared by decomposing casein with trypsin, casein macropeptide which is prepared by decomposing casein with chymosin, casein decapeptide which is prepared by decomposing casein with pepsin, lacto tripeptide which is prepared by decomposing milk serum protein and the like. Among them, casein phosphopeptide (CPP) has an advantageous function of helping the absorption of calcium and like by preliminary bonding with dissolved calcium to prevent bonding of calcium and dietary fibers and the like which prevents, absorption of calcium by intestine. However, the CPP has the characteristic smell called milky smell.

[0327] An object of the present invention is to mask the bitter taste of such amino acids and peptides. The oral composition of the present invention may be of any kind and for any application insofar as they contain such amino acids or peptides.

[0328] Examples of the oral composition include, but are not limited to, the foods such as fruit beverages, tea-based beverages, coffee beverages, soft drinks, powdered beverages, milk beverages, lactic acid bacteria beverages, carbonated beverages, nutrition supplement beverages, beverages enriched with minerals such as calcium; general refreshment foods such as candies, chewing gums, tablet snacks, gummy candies, dry snacks and like confections, jellies, annin dofu, mousse, yogurt and like dessert foods, cakes, cookies, manju and like Western and Japanese sweets, ice creams, sherbets and like cold sweets; rice cakes, ready-to-eat rice and like rice-based dishes; udon, ramen, pasta and like noodles; instant soups, potage and like soups and their powdered instant foods; ketchup, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, tonkatsu sauce, dressings, tartar sauce and like sauces and seasonings; kamaboko, chikuwa, ham, sausage and like processed meat and aquatic products and the like. The foods which are the subject of the present invention include the foods for specified health use.

[0329] Examples of the oral composition of the invention also include vitamin preparations, nutritional supplements and like drugs, oral refreshments, dentifrices, lip balms and like quasi-drugs.

[0330] It is necessary to prepare the oral composition with a masked unpleasant taste according to the present invention that at least the final product contains sucralose. The timing and order of adding sucralose are not critical. The method for adding sucralose is not critical either, and sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution.

[0331] The amount of sucralose to be added to the oral composition is not particularly limited insofar as it is effective in masking the unpleasant taste (bitter taste, etc.) derived from amino acid or peptides, and may be suitably selected depending on the kind and amount of the amino acids and peptide contained in the applied composition, the form of the composition and other conditions. Although not restricted, the amount of sucralose may be suitably selected from the following ranges. For example, sucralose may be used in a concentration of 0.0001 to 0.5% by weight, preferably 0.0001-0.1% by weight, based on 100% by weight of a oral composition. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, when it is used also as a sweetener to impart sweetness, sucralose may be used in the above concentration or higher, while it may be used below the above concentration when a low sweetness is desired. Such amount can be optionally adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0332] According to the present invention, the unpleasant taste derived from the amino acids or peptides can be significantly masked by adding sucralose, and a product which can be easily taken and swallowed can be prepared without spoiling the tastiness of the food.

[0333] Thus, from a different point of view, the present invention provides a masking agent for the unpleasant taste derived from amino acids or peptides by using sucralose as an active ingredient, and a method for masking the unpleasant taste derived from the amino acids or peptides by adding sucralose to an oral composition containing amino acids or peptides for which the unpleasant taste derived from the amino acids or peptides is disadvantageous (or can be disadvantageous).

[0334] The masking agent of the present invention should contain at least sucralose, and may also contain, for example, other sweeteners, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0335] The masking agent for the unpleasant taste of the amino acids of the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granules and the like, or in the form of a solution and suspension. The masking agent in any of these forms is added to the above oral composition at any step of their preparation. Such masking agent may be added to any products (oral compositions) which contain the amino acids or peptides having the unpleasant taste derived from.

[0336] The timing of the addition of the masking agent to the oral compositions is not particularly limited. The amount of the masking agent to be added to the products can be suitably selected based on the above-mentioned amount of sucralose to be added to the oral compositions of the present invention.

III. Performance Food Composition

(1) Sucralose and Hydrocolloid

[0337] This aspect of the invention was accomplished based on the findings that a combination of sucralose and a specific hydrocolloid imparts, to a food composition, desired physical properties such as viscosity, gel-like texture or emulsifiability; and that the physical properties can be easily adjusted by modifying the ratio of these ingredients suitably according to the type of food composition. The invention provides the following performance food compositions comprising sucralose and at least one hydrocolloid.

[0338] (1-1). A viscous food composition comprising sucralose and at least one hydrocolloid selected from the group consisting of locust bean gum, λ-carrageenan and soybean polysaccharides.

[0339] (1-2). A gel food composition comprising sucralose and at least one hydrocolloid selected from the group consisting of agar, gellan gum, native gellan gum, gelatin, K-carrageenan, L-carrageenan, pectin, tamarind seed polysaccharides, alginic acid, alginic acid salts, tara gum, furcellaran and curdlan, in particular at least one hydrocolloid selected from the group consisting of agar, gellan gum, native gellan gum and K-carrageenan.

[0340] (1-3). An emulsified food composition comprising sucralose and at least one hydrocolloid selected from the group consisting of gum arabic and xanthan gum.

(1-1). Viscous Food Composition

[0341] Various hydrocolloids have been conventionally used as a thickening agent, a stabilizer, a gelling agent or the like for preparation of viscous foods. However, many hydrocolloids are liable to give heavy eating characteristics, when used in combination with sugar. Thus, it has been difficult to prepare a food having desired degree of sweetness and viscosity.

[0342] The present invention provides a variety of food compositions having a good sweetness and a viscosity desirable for the type of food. Specifically, the present invention employs sucralose in combination with guar gum, locust bean gum, λ-carrageenan or soybean polysaccharide to obtain well-balanced sweetness and viscosity, so that a viscous food composition having both of a good sweetness and a desired viscosity can be easily prepared. These hydrocolloids may be used either singly or in combination.

[0343] The amount of sucralose to be used for achieving the effects of the invention is usually 0.0001 to 1 wt. %, preferably 0.0005 to 0.5 wt. %, based on the viscous food composition. Since the sweetness of sucralose is clearly felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more, a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % can be employed when a reduced sweetness is desired. Suitable adjustment of the amount is well within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0344] The amount of hydrocolloid to be used for achieving the effects of the invention is usually 0.01 to 10 wt. %, preferably 0.5 to 5 wt. %, based on the viscous food composition.

[0345] The composition of the invention may contain, in addition to the sucralose and hydrocolloid, another sweetener, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0346] Viscous food compositions according to the invention include a variety of hydrous foods having such viscosity that the foods are collapsible by its own weight. Thus, the food composition of the invention may be a low viscosity composition such as a soft drink or a carbonated beverage, or a relatively high viscosity food such as shiruko (azuki bean soup), as long as it has such viscosity.

[0347] More specifically, examples of the viscous food composition of the invention include cocoa beverages, coffee beverages, calcium-enriched beverages, powdered green tea beverages, vegetable or fruit juice-containing beverages, soybean milk beverages, drinks, jelly beverages, shiruko drinks, milk beverages such as yogurt beverages and lactic acid bacteria beverages, and various other beverages; corn soups, potages and other soups; dressings, tare (Japanese style sauce), sauces and other liquid seasonings.

[0348] The food composition of the invention having a good viscosity can be prepared by a variety of processes for preparing foods, as long as the final product comprises sucralose and the hydrocolloid. Thus, there is no limitation on the timing, method, order and other factors of addition of sucralose and the hydrocolloid. For example, sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or in the form of a solution. The hydrocolloid can be prepared in consideration of their properties (e.g., melting point). For example, it is used as dissolved or dispersed in water and then heated at about 70 to 95° C.

(1-2). Gel Food Composition

[0349] Various hydrocolloids have been conventionally used as a gelling agent for preparing a gel food. However, many hydrocolloids are liable to give heavy eating characteristics, when used in combination with sugar. Thus, it has been difficult to prepare a food having a desired sweetness and desired gel food eating characteristics (e.g., texture and chewing characteristics).

[0350] The present invention provides a variety of food compositions having a suitable sweetness and good eating characteristics (e.g., texture and chewing characteristics) desirable for the type of food. Specifically, the present invention utilizes sucralose in combination with a specific hydrocolloid to obtain well-balanced sweetness and eating characteristics, so that a gel food composition having both of a good sweetness and desired eating characteristics (texture, chewing characteristics, etc.) can be easily prepared.

[0351] Examples of hydrocolloids for use in the invention include agar, gellan gum, native gellan gum, gelatin, κ-carrageenan, λ-carrageenan, ι-carrageenan, locust bean gum, pectin, tamarind seed polysaccharides, alginic acid, alginic acid salts, guar gum, tara gum, furcellaran and curdlan. These hydrocolloids can be used either singly or in combination. Among them, particularly preferable are agar, gellan gum, native gellan gum and κ-carrageenan. Use of at least one of these hydrocolloids in combination with sucralose enables preparation of a gel food composition having a suitable sweetness and light eating characteristics.

[0352] Agar, gellan gum, gelatin, κ-carrageenan, λ-carrageenan, ι-carrageenan, pectin, locust bean gum, tamarind seed polysaccharides, alginic acid, alginic acid salts, guar gum, tara gum, furcellaran and curdlan are those conventionally used as a gelling agent for foods.

[0353] Native gellan gum for use in the present invention is a macromolecular polysaccharide of the microbial origin which is available as the pre-deacylation precursor of gellan gum. This native gellan gum is generally produced by culture of microorganisms. Specifically, a typical production technology comprises inoculating Pseudomonas elodea (ATCC31461) or an equivalent strain in a liquid medium containing 3% of glucose, 0.05% of KH4NO3, 0.01% of MgSO4′7H2O, 0.09% of NH4NO3, and a minor proportion of organic nitrogenous matter, growing the strain at about 30° C. under aerobic conditions for about 50 hours, and isolating and recovering a mucilaginous substance produced on the cell surface from the resulting culture broth without deacylation (Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 79397/1980).

[0354] Since native gellan gum is of the natural origin, its structure may vary subtly according to the producer strain used and purification conditions. In this sense, the native gellan gum for use in the invention is not categorically defined by any chemical formula (Sanderson, G. R., Food Gels, ed. Peter Harris, Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd., England, 1990, p. 204) but may be any substance having the properties of the native gellan gum produced by the above-mentioned technology using said stain of microorganism (ATCC31461).

[0355] The amount of sucralose to be used for achieving the effects of the invention is usually 0.0001 to 1 wt. %, preferably 0.0005 to 0.5 wt. %, based on the viscous food composition. The sweetness of sucralose itself is clearly felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more. Therefore, when a reduced sweetness is desired, a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % can be employed, according to the type of targeted food and desired taste. Suitable adjustment of the amount is well within the ordinary skill level in the art. The amount of hydrocolloid to be used for achieving the effects of the invention is usually 0.01 to 10 wt. %, preferably 0.5 to 5 wt. %, based on the viscous food composition.

[0356] The composition of the invention may contain, in addition to the sucralose and hydrocolloid, another sweetener, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0357] Gel food compositions according to the invention include a variety of hydrous foods having such viscosity that the foods are not collapsible by its own weight. The food composition of the invention may be a food with low gel strength, such as pudding, or a food with high gel strength, such as yokan (sweet jelled bean paste), as long as it has such viscosity.

[0358] More specifically, examples of gel food composition according to the invention include puddings, bavaroises, jellies, mousses, annin dofu (almond jelly), gummy candies, marshmallows, yokan and other Japanese or Western confections, konjac (jellylike food made from the root of a bulbous herb), tofu (bean curd), rice cakes, hams, sausages and terrines.

[0359] The present invention also encompasses, in its scope, foods containing the above gel food composition as a part.

[0360] Preferred examples of such foods include, but not limited to, foods comprising a gel portion made of a gel food composition such as pudding, bavarois, jelly or mousse, and a cream portion containing fat and oil. The cream portion may be any of a variety of creams described hereinafter ((1-3). Emulsified food composition).

[0361] Combinations of the gel portion and the cream portion are not limited, as long as the gel and cream portions can be tasted together when eaten. For example, the food may comprise cream portion(s) on the top of, in the middle of and/or under the bottom of the gel portion(s), or may comprise continuous or discontinuous layers of gel portion(s) and cream portion(s).

[0362] In the food of the invention, the cream portion may contain sucralose so that the cream has smoother eating characteristics, which, in combination with good eating characteristics (texture and chewing characteristics) of the gel portion, give the food a more palatable taste. Further, when the cream contain a milk fat, addition of sucralose will bring out the milk flavor and produces a cream having enhanced milky characteristics. The amount of sucralose to be added to the cream portion is not limited, and may be 0.00001 to 0.5 wt. %, preferably 0.0001 to 0.5 wt. %, per 100 wt. % of the cream.

[0363] The gel food composition with good eating characteristics of the invention can be prepared by a variety of processes for preparing foods, as long as the final product comprises the sucralose and hydrocolloid. Thus, there is no limitation on the timing, method, order and other factors of addition of the sucralose and hydrocolloid. For example, sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or in the form of a solution. The hydrocolloid can be prepared in consideration of the properties (physicochemical properties). For example, the hydrocolloid is used as dissolved or dispersed in water and then heated at about 70 to 95° C.

(1-3). Emulsified Food Composition

[0364] Conventionally, emulsifiers have been widely used to ensure good emulsification in preparation of emulsified foods such as mayonnaises, dressings, margarines and whipped creams. Generally used emulsifiers are lecithin and fatty acid esters such as glycerin fatty acid esters and sucrose fatty acid esters. However, many of these emulsifiers have limitations regarding type of targeted food and amount to be used, owing to their influence on the taste of foods.

[0365] The present invention was achieved based on the findings that sucralose as such has emulsifying power, and that combined use of sucralose and a specific hydrocolloid enhances the emulsifying power and produces an emulsified food composition having smooth eating characteristics and a good taste, without influence on the taste of the food. The present invention provides an emulsified food composition having delicate and smooth eating characteristics, without impairing the taste of the food itself.

[0366] Sucralose for use in the emulsified food composition of the invention shows emulsion stabilizing effects by itself, and can be used in a wide variety of emulsified foods.

[0367] According to the invention, the emulsified foods or emulsified food compositions are foods comprising, as the whole or a part, a monolayer mixture of water and fat and/or oil. Such foods include not only dressings, mayonnaises and like foods, but also foods prepared using milk, butter and the like.

[0368] Fats and oils usable in the invention include, for example, corn oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil, cotton seed oil, safflower oil, rice oil, palm oil, coconut oil and other vegetable oils, and fish oil, animal fats and oils and hydrogenated fats and oils, fractionated fats and oils, transesterified fats and oils prepared from the above fats and oils. These fats and oils can be used either singly or in combination.

[0369] The amount of sucralose to be used for achieving the effects of the invention is usually 0.0001 to 1 wt. %, preferably 0.0005 to 0.5 wt. %, based on the emulsified food composition. The sweetness of sucralose is clearly felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more. Therefore, when a reduced sweetness is desired, a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % can be employed according to the type of food and desired taste. Suitable adjustment of the amount is well within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0370] Sucralose, even used alone, has high emulsion stabilizing effects, but it imparts higher emulsion stability and delicate, smooth eating characteristics to an emulsified composition, when used in combination with a hydrocolloid.

[0371] Hydrocolloids for use in the invention include, for example, gum arabic and xanthan gum. They can be used either singly or in combination. The amount of hydrocolloid to be used for achieving the effects of the invention is usually 0.01 to 10 wt. %, preferably 0.5 to 5 wt. %, based on the emulsified food composition.

[0372] For preparation of emulsified compositions, emulsification operation is performed. A wide variety of conventional emulsification methods can be employed. Examples of such methods include methods using emulsifying machines such as homogenizers, colloid mills, texture analyzersvacuum emulsifying machines, votators, onlator and like emulsifying machines generally used for preparation of emulsified foods.

[0373] The emulsified food composition of the invention having good eating characteristics can be prepared by a variety of processes for preparing emulsified foods, as long as the final product comprises sucralose and hydrocolloid. Thus, there is no limitation on the timing, method, order and other factors of addition of sucralose and hydrocolloid. For example, sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or in the form of a solution. The hydrocolloid can be prepared in consideration of properties (physicochemical properties). For example, the hydrocolloid can be used as dissolved or dispersed in water and then heated at about 70 to 95° C.

[0374] The composition of the invention may contain, in addition to the sucralose and hydrocolloid, another sweetener, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0375] The composition of the invention may be a food containing the above gel food composition as a part, and such an embodiment is encompassed within the scope of the invention.

[0376] Preferred examples of such foods include, but not limited to, foods comprising a cream portion made of the emulsified food composition described above, and a gel food composition described hereinbefore, such as pudding, bavarois, jelly or mousse (see (1-2). Gel food composition).

[0377] The cream portion may comprise any of a variety of creams such as: animal creams containing milk fat and prepared using raw milk, market milk, specialized milk or like milk product as a raw material; and vegetable creams containing coconut oil, palm kernel oil, cacao butter or like vegetable fat or oil. The fat or oil content is not limited, and the cream may be, for example, half-and-half cream with a milk fat content of 10 to 18 wt. %, light cream with a milk fat content of about 19 wt. %, whipping cream with a milk fat content of 30 to 40 wt. %, double cream with a milk fat content of at least 45 wt. %, or heavy cream with a milk fat content of 60 to 80 wt. %; cream containing 10 to 30 wt. % of vegetable oil, or whipping cream containing 30 to 50 wt. % of vegetable oil; etc. These creams are used as coffee whitener, whipping cream, butter cream, ice cream or the like, according to the fat or oil content.

[0378] Combinations of the gel portion and the cream portion are not limited, as long as the gel and cream portions can be tasted together when eaten. For example, the food may comprise cream portion(s) on the top of, in the middle of and/or under the bottom of gel portion(s), or may comprise continuous or discontinuous layers of gel portion(s) and cream portion(s).

(2) Sucralose and Starch

[0379] This aspect of the invention was accomplished based on the following findings: sucralose, when used in combination with any of various starches, allows the starches to show their specific functions more remarkably, making it possible to prepare a starch-containing food with good eating characteristics by using no agent for imparting properties; and even when using a property imparting agent, the necessary amount is significantly smaller than the amount required in the prior art. The present invention provides a performance food composition comprising sucralose and starch.

(2-1). Food Composition Comprising Starch and Sucralose

[0380] Starch-containing foods with unique eating characteristics have been developed utilizing various functions of starch such as thickening effect, gelling effect, water retention effect, oil encapsulation effect, etc. However, starch foods containing starch and sugar are liable to have heavy eating characteristics, and are difficult to show desired functions of starch. Conventionally, therefore, various agents for imparting properties are added to allow starch to show desired functions.

[0381] The present invention provides a starch food that shows desired good eating characteristics owing to functions of starch, using no or a slight amount of property imparting agent. The invention also provides a starch food that exhibits a good sweetness without hindering the functions of starch.

[0382] Starches for use in the invention are not limited and include, for example, potato starch, sweet potato starch, corn starch, waxy corn starch, wheat starch, rice starch, glutinous rice starch, tapioca starch, green gram starch, kuzu (arrowroot) starch, saga starch, amaranth and modified starch. Preferred are potato starch, sweet potato starch, cornstarch, waxy corn starch, wheat starch and rice starch. These starches generally have high water retentivity and are capable of being thickened or gelled by incorporation of water. Further, they have high affinity to oils and are likely to encapsulate oils.

[0383] Starch foods according to the invention include a variety of foods containing any of the above starches. Preferred is a food containing starch in an amount of usually 0.01 to 50 wt. % of the starch so as to achieve specific desired eating characteristics, such as body, richness, viscosity, softness, glutinousness, tenderness, elasticity, etc.

[0384] Specific examples of starch foods include, but not limited to, wheat starch-containing foods such as baked or steamed products including okonomi-yaki (pan cake with vegetables, meat or seafood), tako-yaki (spherical fried batter containing a diced pieces of octopus), cakes, cookies, breads and nans, and noodle products including udon (thick white wheat noodle), Chinese noodles and pastas; corn starch-containing baked or steamed products and creams; baked or steamed Japanese confections or rice confections, containing rice starch or glutinous rice starch [e.g., joshinko (rice flour), shiratamako (non-glutinous white rice flour) and kanbaiko (ground toasted rice flour)] or sweet potato starch; fish paste products containing potato starch, such as kamaboko (loaf of pureed, steamed fish).

[0385] The amount of sucralose to be used for achieving the effects of the invention varies depending on the type of food, desired eating characteristics and like factors, and can not be generalized. Usually, the starch food of the invention may contain sucralose in a concentration of 0.0001 to 1 wt. %, preferably 0.0005 to 0.1 wt. %. The sweetness of sucralose is clearly felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more, a concentration more than 0.0006 wt. % can be employed when sucralose is intended to serve also as a sweetener, or a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % can be employed when a reduced sweetness is desired. Suitable adjustment of the amount is well within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0386] For preparation of the starch food of the invention, there is no limitation on the timing, order and other factors of addition of sucralose, as long as the final product comprises sucralose and starch. Also, sucralose can be added by any method without limitation, and may be added in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or in the form of a solution.

[0387] The starch food of the invention may contain, in addition to sucralose and starch, another sweetener, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0388] According to the invention, sucralose is added to a starch food so that the food significantly retains and shows properties unique to starch foods (e.g., viscosity, body, richness, softness, glutinousness, tenderness and elasticity) which can be attained by the functions of starch, such as water retention, thickening and gelling.

[0407] The order and method of addition of sucralose are not limited as long as the refreshment beverage contains sucralose when ingested. The refreshment beverage can be prepared by various processes for preparing beverages.

[0408] For achieving the effect of the invention, the refreshment beverage contains sucralose in a concentration of 0.0001 to 0.1 wt. %, when drunk. The sweetness of sucralose is felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.001 wt. % or more, although depending on individual palate and conditions and the type of food. Therefore, when sweetness of sucralose is not desired, a concentration of 0.0001 to 0.001% can be employed, so that a refreshment beverage with a suppressed sweetness and a desired good flavor can be prepared.

[0409] The invention also provides a method for improving (enhancing) a flavor of a refreshment beverage by adding the above specified amount of sucralose to the refreshment beverage; and a process for preparing a flavor-improved (enhanced) refreshment beverage, comprising the step of adding the above-specified amount of sucralose.

(3). Tea Beverage and Tea-Containing Food

[0410] The present invention was accomplished based on the finding that sucralose, when added to tea, brings out the inherent flavor of the tea, and produces tea with a good flavor.

[0411] Teas according to the invention include non-fermented tea and fermented tea.

[0412] As used herein, the term “tea” is intended to mean drinkable tea obtained from a various types of tea leaves (for example, tea beverages in cans, PET bottles or other containers); drinkable or edible solid tea, such as pulverized or granulated tea leaves, or powder or granules prepared from the drinkable tea by lyophilization or like treatment; or tea leaves as such.

(a) Non-Fermented Tea

[0413] Non-fermented tea is tea produced without a fermentation step, such as sen-cha (ordinary green tea), gyokuro (high-quality green tea), ban-cha (coarse tea), powdered green tea prepared from ten-cha or the like, and other green teas. These teas may be produced by any processes without limitation, and include steamed tea and pot-roasted tea, wherein enzymes have been inactivated by steaming or pot-roasting. Preferred non-fermented teas include sen-cha, gyokuro and powdered green tea, among which powdered green tea is particularly preferred.

[0414] The non-fermented tea of the invention is characterized by containing sucralose. The amount of sucralose to be added is not limited as long as the amount is effective in enhancing or increasing a flavor of non-fermented tea. Usually, in the case of a beverage, the final tea beverage product may contain sucralose in a concentration of 0.00001 to 0.5 wt. %, preferably 0.0001 to 0.1 wt. %. Since the sweetness of sucralose is clearly felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more, a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % can be employed when a reduced sweetness is desired. Suitable adjustment of the concentration is well within the ordinary skill level in the art. In the case of tea leaves as such, a powdered green tea or an instant powdered tea, the concentration of sucralose is selected so that a drinkable tea prepared by adding an ordinary amount of hot water or cold water contain sucralose in the concentration specified above.

[0415] The non-fermented tea of the invention does not need to be produced in the presence of sucralose, as long as the final product contains sucralose. Thus, the timing, order and other factors of addition of sucralose are not limited. Also, the method of addition of sucralose is not limited, and sucralose may be added in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or in the form of a solution.

[0416] Generally, preferred sen-cha has balanced bitterness and savoriness, and a cool aftertaste. Preferred gyokuro has a deep savoriness, a light bitterness and a round and rich aftertaste. For ban-cha or medium-quality sen-cha, a light and cool bitterness is preferred to savoriness. Further, preferred powdered green tea has a deep aroma, a light bitterness and a high savoriness. According to the invention, sucralose is added to emphasize aroma and flavor unique to each type of non-fermented tea, thereby giving a non-fermented tea with a good flavor excellent in roundness, richness, etc.

[0417] The present invention also provides a food containing a non-fermented tea comprising sucralose. Non-fermented tea-containing foods mean foods containing a non-fermented tea at least as a part, or foods prepared using a non-fermented tea. Usable non-fermented teas include not only the above-mentioned tea leaves, drinkable teas, edible solid teas and solid teas for drinks (such as instant powdered tea), but also other tea products containing tea ingredients such as sen-cha, gyokuro, powdered green tea or ban-cha. The non-fermented tea-containing foods include, but not limited to, puddings and jellies, ice creams and other cold sweets, candies, an (azuki bean jam), senbei (rice cracker), cookies, manju (steamed azuki bean jam-filled bun), cakes and other confections containing non-fermented tea; milk beverages, carbonated beverages, soft drinks and other beverages containing non-fermented tea; and liqueurs, sake and other alcoholic beverages containing non-fermented tea, such as green tea liqueur.

These aquatic products may be prepared as, but not limited to, canned smoked oil-marinated foods. Examples of milk products include cheeses.

[0523] These products may be cold smoked products prepared by smoke-drying at a low temperature (10 to 30° C.) for a relatively long period to a water content of 40% or less; warm smoked products prepared by smoke-drying at a relatively high temperature (30 to 50° C.) for a short period; hot smoked or roast-smoked products prepared by smoke-drying at 50 to 80° C. or at 80 to 120° C.; liquid-smoked products prepared by treatment with a smoke flavor followed by drying; or electrically smoked products prepared by electrically charging smoke particles to accelerate deposition of the smoke particles to foods. Thus, there is no limitation on the type of treatment. Application of the present invention is particularly advantageous for, among the other products, liquid-smoked products and electrically smoked products, which can be obtained as large-scale products by relatively large batch treatment, but are inferior in the flavor unique to smoked products.

[0524] For preparing the smoked product of the invention having enhanced smoky characteristics, the timing, order and other factors of addition of sucralose are not limited as long as the final product contains sucralose. Preferably, sucralose is added so that the food ingredient before smoking (ingredient to be smoked) contains sucralose. Alternatively, when using a smoke flavor, sucralose may be added to the smoke flavor.

[0525] The form of sucralose to be added is not limited, and may be a solid such as a powder or granules, or a solution.

[0526] The concentration of sucralose in a smoked product (ingredient to be smoked) is not limited as long as it is effective in enhancing (increasing) smoky characteristics of the smoked product, and may be suitably selected according to the type and ingredients of smoked product and the type of smoking treatment. Specifically, the concentration of sucralose may be, but not limited to, 0.0001 to 0.1, based on the final smoked product. Since the sweetness of sucralose is clearly felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more, a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % can be employed when a reduced sweetness is desired. Suitable adjustment of the concentration is well within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0527] For preparation of a liquid-smoked product, sucralose can be added to the smoke flavor to obtain a sucralose-containing smoke flavor. In this case, sucralose can be added in an amount of 0.001 to 1 wt. % per 100 wt. % of smoke flavor.

[0528] The smoking material, smoking process and smoke flavor (wood vinegar) for preparing the smoked product with enhanced smoky characteristics of the invention may be any of those conventionally employed, and can be selected according to the type of the food and desired taste.

[0529] According to the invention, sucralose is added to an ingredient to be smoked, or a smoke flavor used for treatment of an ingredient, to emphasize a flavor (smoke flavor) and taste unique to smoked products, so that a food with a good flavor can be prepared which has eating characteristics unique to smoked products.

[0530] The invention also provides a novel use of sucralose as a smoky characteristic enhancer for a smoked product. The smoky characteristic enhancer comprises at least sucralose, and may contain, in addition to sucralose, another sweetener, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0531] The smoky characteristic enhancer of the invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or a solution. The enhancer in any of these forms is added at a desired stage of preparation of the smoked products or smoke flavors mentioned above. Addition of the smoked characteristic enhancer brings out the flavor unique to smoked products, so that a smoked food with enhanced smoky characteristics can be prepared or obtained.

[0532] There is no limitation on the timing of the smoked characteristic enhancer of the invention. The concentration of the smoked characteristic enhancer in a smoked product can be suitably selected based on the concentration of sucralose in the smoked product of the invention described above.

[0533] The invention also provides a method for enhancing (increasing) smoky characteristics of a smoked product by adding sucralose in the effective amount specified above; and a process for preparing a smoked product with enhanced (increased) smoky characteristics, comprising the step of adding the effective amount of sucralose.

(e) Tobacco

[0534] Tobaccos according to the invention include a wide variety of tobaccos such as ordinary cigarettes comprising cut tobacco leaves rolled in paper, leaf tobaccos, cut tobaccos and cigars.

[0535] According to the invention, sucralose is added to tobacco leaves or tobacco leaves are impregnated with sucralose, so as to give roundness to the taste of tobacco and produce a tobacco with a good rich flavor.

[0536] To obtain the tobacco of the invention having an enhanced quality, the timing, order and other factors of addition of sucralose are not limited, as long as the final tobacco product contains sucralose. Also, the method of addition of sucralose is not limited, and sucralose may be added in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or a solution. Specifically, sucralose can be added by a method comprising impregnating dried and processed tobacco leaves (such as cut leaves) with a sucralose solution, drying the leaves again, and wrapping the leaves in paper; or a method comprising admixing a sucralose powder or sucralose granules with cut leaves, and wrapping the mixture in paper. However, these methods are not limitative.

[0537] The amount of sucralose to be added to a tobacco is not limited as long as the amount is effective in enhancing (increasing) the quality of the tobacco, and may be suitably selected according to the type and nicotine content of the tobacco, and other factors. Specifically, the concentration of sucralose may be, but not limited to, 0.0001 to 0.1 wt. % based on the tobacco leaves.

[0538] The invention further provides a quality enhancer for a tobacco, comprising sucralose, i.e., an high intense sweetener, as an active ingredient. The quality enhancer of the invention comprises at least sucralose, and may contain, in addition to sucralose, another sweetener, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0539] The quality enhancer of the invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or a solution. The quality enhancer in any of these forms is added at a desired stage of preparation of the tobaccos mentioned above. Addition of the tobacco quality enhancer gives roundness to the taste of a tobacco, so that a tobacco with an enhanced quality can be prepared.

[0540] The timing of addition of the tobacco quality enhancer is not limited. Also, the concentration of the enhancer in a tobacco can be suitably selected based on the concentration of sucralose in the tobacco of the invention.

[0541] The invention further provides a method for enhancing (increasing) the quality of a tobacco by adding the effective amount of sucralose to a tobacco, and a process for preparing a tobacco with an enhanced (increased) quality, comprising the step of adding the effective amount of sucralose.

V. Preservative and Food with Improved Quality of Taste

[0542] This aspect of the invention was accomplished based on the findings that addition of sucralose to a preservative to be added to a food improves a taste of the preservative, and that addition of sucralose to a food significantly improves a taste of the food.

[0543] The present invention provides:

(1) a food preservative with an improved taste, comprising sucralose; and
(2) a food with an improved taste comprising sucralose.
(1) A food preservative comprising sucralose

[0544] Preservatives have been conventionally employed to inhibit putrefaction or deterioration caused by microorganisms, thereby preventing food poisoning and enhance storage stability of foods. However, some preservatives may impair tastes of foods by their own tastes or by combination with some types of foods. Such preservatives, even if having excellent preserving power, have limitations regarding application range and amount to be used.

[0545] The present invention was accomplished based on the finding that addition of sucralose to a specific food preservative masks the unpleasant taste specific to the preservative, and produces a preservative having an improved taste and no influence on the palatability (savoriness, taste) of the food containing the preservative.

[0546] Specific examples of food preservatives for use in the invention include sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, sodium propionate, sodium acetate and sodium dehydroacetate; butyl paraoxybenzoate, isobutyl paraoxybenzoate, propyl paraoxybenzoate and like organic acid esters; sodium sulfite, sodium hyposulfite, potassium pyrosulfite, sodium pyrosulfite, sulfur dioxide and like inorganic salts; hinokitiol, Japanese styrax benzoin extract, peptin extract and like plant extracts or plant decomposed products, milt protein extract, ε-polylysine and like proteins and their decomposed products; and glycine and chitosan.

[0547] The preservative for use in the invention may be a preservative which has been approved as a food additive by the ministry of health of Japan or other countries and which substantially serves to enhance storage stability of a food when added to the food. Thus, the preservative for use in the invention may be any of specified additives, known additives and general food and drink additives. Preferred examples include sodium acetate, glycine, chitosan, milt protein extract and ε-polylysine. These preservatives have sweetness, astringency, harshness or other characteristic tastes, and therefore, when added to a food, influences the taste of the food. These food preservatives can be used either singly or in combination.

[0548] The concentration of sucralose in the food preservative varies according to the type of the food preservative, and cannot be generalized. Usually, however, sucralose is added in a concentration of 0.001 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.005 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the preservative. Use of the above amount of sucralose in combination of a preservative improves the taste of the preservative by masking or alleviating an unpleasant taste of the preservative. As a result, the preservative does not adversely affect the taste or savoriness of the food containing the preservative, and thus is applicable to a wide variety of foods.

[0549] The preservative of the invention comprises the above essential ingredients, and may further contains a sweetener other than sucralose, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0550] The form of the preservative of the invention is not limited, and may be a solution in water or the like, a powder or granules obtained by spray-drying, or tablets prepared from the powder or granules.

[0551] The preservative of the invention can be used as mixed with a variety of oral compositions, in particular foods, according to the type of the food preservative used in the preservative of the invention.

[0552] The preservative of the invention is applicable to a wide variety of processed foods which need to contain a preservative, according to the type, properties and effects of the food preservative contained therein.

[0553] Examples of processed foods include a wide variety of processed foods such as chawan-mushi (steamed egg custard), tamago-dofu (chilled egg custard), custard puddings, custard creams, atsuyaki tamago (thick fried egg) and other egg products; processed animal and aquatic products (such as fish paste products, canned products, salt cured products); flour pastes; pickles vegetables and pickled fish; ready-to-eat dishes; margarines, cheeses, yogurts, butters and other milk products; soy sauces, misos, sauces, ketchups, mayonnaises and other seasonings; carbonated beverages, coffees, soft drinks, milk coffee and other milk beverages, lactic acid bacteria beverages, nutritional beverages, soybean milk beverages and other beverages; candies, gums, tableted confections, gummy candies, snack foods and other confections, jellies, annin dofu, mousses, yogurts and other dessert foods; cakes, cookies, manju and other Japanese and Western confections; ice creams, sherbets and other cold sweets; breads, rice cakes and instant rices, udon, ramen, pastas and other starch foods; instant soups, potages and other soups and instant powdered soups; and tofu, abura-age (fried tofu) including usu-age (thin fried tofu) and atsu-age (thick fried tofu), ganmodoki (tofu-based fried dish), yuba (soybean curd film) and other tofu processed foods.

[0554] By addition of the preservative of the invention, the above foods can be prepared as highly preservable foods which are significantly protected from putrefaction or the like caused by growth of microorganisms, without influence on the tastes of the foods. To obtain such a food, the timing, order and other factors of addition of sucralose and a food preservative are not limited, as long as the final product contains sucralose and the food preservative, in particular sodium acetate, glycine, chitosan, milt protein extract or E-polylysine. Also, the method of addition of these ingredients is not limited, and each of them may be added in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or a solution.

[0555] For achieving the effects of the invention, the concentration of the preservative of the invention in a food varies according to the type of the food and the type and amount of protein material contained in the food, and cannot be generalized. A person of skill in the art would be able to adjust the amount suitably according to desired preserving effects. Since the sweetness of sucralose is clearly felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more, a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more can be employed when sucralose is intended to serve also as a sweetener. Alternatively, sucralose can be used in a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % when a reduced sweetness is desired. Suitable adjustment of the amount is well within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0556] According to the invention, sucralose is added so that an unpleasant taste caused by a food preservative can be significantly masked without impairing the preserving effect of the food preservative. Therefore, the preservative of the invention is applicable to a wide variety of foods, as a preservative without influence on tastes of foods.

[0557] The invention also provides a novel use of sucralose as a taste improving agent for a food preservative. The taste improving agent comprises at least sucralose, and may contain a sweetener other than sucralose, a flavor, a preservative, a stabilizer or like ingredient, within the range that does not adversely affect the effects of the invention.

[0558] The food preservative taste improving agent of the invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or a solution. The agent in any of these forms can be used in combination with any of the food preservatives mentioned above. Addition of the taste improving agent significantly masks unpleasant tastes characteristic of food preservatives, so that the resulting food preservatives are applicable to all types of foods, without limitations caused by the unpleasant tastes characteristics of food preservatives.

[0559] The amount of the taste improving agent to be added to a food preservative is suitably selected based on the concentration of sucralose in a food preservative described above.

[0560] The invention also provides a method for improving a taste of a food preservative by adding the above effective amount of sucralose to a food preservative, and a process for preparing a food preservative with an improved taste, comprising the step of adding the effective amount of sucralose.

(2) General Foods

[0561] The present invention was accomplished based on the finding that addition of sucralose to a food improves a taste of the food, brings out an inherent taste of the food, and alleviates an undesirable taste, to thereby enhance the overall tastiness of the food; and the finding that the above effects can be achieved by use of sucralose within a concentration range within which sucralose does not exhibit its sweetener effect.

[0562] To obtain the food with an improved taste of the invention, the timing, order and other factors of addition of sucralose are not limited, as long as the final product contains sucralose. Also, the method for addition of sucralose is not limited, and sucralose may be added in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or a solution.

[0563] For achieving the effects of the invention, the amount of sucralose to be added to a food varies according to the type of food and other factors, and cannot be generalized. Usually, however, the concentration of sucralose is 0.00001 to 0.5 wt. %, preferably 0.0001 to 0.1 wt. %, based on the food. The sweetness of sucralose is felt when sucralose is contained in a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more, in the case of an aqueous solution. Therefore, a concentration of 0.0006 wt. % or more can be employed when sucralose is intended to serve also as a sweetener, and used in a concentration less than 0.0006 wt. % when a reduced sweetness is desired. Suitable adjustment of the amount is well within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0564] According to the invention, a taste of a food is significantly improved, an inherent taste of the food is brought out and enhanced, and an undesirable taste is alleviated, thereby providing a food improved in overall tastiness. Further, according to the invention, undesirable flavors caused by minerals or vitamins contained in the food is masked, and when the food contains a common salt or potassium salt, the food will have a round and high-quality taste, with an enhanced salt flavor, suppressed salty edge and masked bitterness. Especially in a food containing a common salt, a pleasant sweetness is further enhanced, giving a more palatable food.

[0565] The food of the invention may contain any other sweeteners in combination with sucralose. Further, any other edible ingredients that enhance flavors of foods, such as vitamin C and flavonoids are also usable.

[0566] The food with an improved taste according to the invention may be any type of food. Sucralose may be added to an ingredient of a food, may be added during the production process of a food, or may be sprinkled over a food produced. Alternatively, a food or preparation containing sucralose can be ingested together with another food. Namely, the timing, order and other factors of addition of sucralose to a food are not limited as long as the food is ingested together with sucralose.

[0567] Specific examples of foods with an improved taste according to the invention include foods comprising at least one of the following foods; foods prepared using, as an ingredient, at least one of the following foods; and foods comprising at least one of the following foods.

[0608] The present invention provides new use of sucralose as a taste improver for improving the taste of foods. The taste improver comprises at least sucralose and may further contain other sweeteners than sucralose, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and like other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0609] Further, the present invention provides a method for improving the taste of foods, which comprises incorporating the effective amount of sucralose into the aforementioned various foods, and a process for producing taste-improved foods, which comprises incorporating said effective amount of sucralose into the foods.

VI. Flavor Compositions with Improved Flavors

[0610] Flavors such as menthol and spearmint are incorporated into chewing gums, candies and like confectionery products, mouthwash solutions and dentifrices to provide cool refreshing flavor. However, most of the products provide cool flavor and aspirated air refreshment for the first several minutes, after which such effects decline with time, thus failing to provide cool flavor and aspirated air refreshment for a long time. There has been an attempt to enhance cooling effect and aspirated air refreshing effect by increasing the amount of flavor to be used. However, if the amount of menthol exceeds 3%, methanol itself brings out bitterness and there arise problems of acridity and bitterness derived from the flavor component contained in the flavor. Therefore, such products are particularly unsuitable for oral use. Especially in the case of gums, a flavor, if used in a large amount, causes essential oil to plasticize the gum base, whereby texture (eating characteristics) and consistency will change, thus being undesirable.

[0611] The present invention has been accomplished based on the finding that addition of sucralose to a flavor component such as menthol or carvone enhances flavors (aroma, cool flavor, refreshing flavor) of the flavor component, so that even a low amount of the flavor component can provide a flavor composition with improved flavor.

[0612] Menthols usable in the present invention include 1-menthol, d-menthol and d,1-menthol. Preferred is 1-menthol. Carvones usable in the present invention include 1-carvone, d-carvone and d,1-carvone. Preferred is 1-carvone. As menthol or carvone of the invention, 1-menthol or 1-carvone may be used as it is or an essential oil containing each component such as peppermint, Japanese mint or spearmint may be used. The flavor components may be used singly or in combination of two or more.

[0613] The flavor composition according to the present invention may be any of the compositions containing menthol or carvone (spearmint). Preferred are compositions prepared by incorporating menthol or carvone (or spearmint) with the purpose of providing enhanced cool flavor and refreshing flavor, based on the flavor unique to the flavor component.

[0614] Such flavor compositions include, for example, confections such as chewing gums and like gums, hard or soft candies, gummi and like candies, and chocolates; beverages such as herb teas; alcoholic beverages such as liqueurs; cleaning or refreshing compositions for oral cavity such as mouth washes, dental cream toothpastes, liquid toothpastes, mouthwashes, dental rinses, mouth sprays and gingival massage; drugs such as antibacterial disinfectants for oral cavity or throat, oral liquids, nasal drops, oral ointments and oral pasta; quasi-drugs and cosmetics such as lip creams, cosmetic preparations, body powders, body shampoos, hair shampoos and rinses.

[0615] Preferred are oral compositions such as the above-mentioned chewing gums, candies, beverages, chocolates and like foods; mouth washes, toothpastes, mouthwashes, mouth sprays or like compositions for oral cavity; antibacterial disinfectants for oral cavity or throat, oral liquids, nasal drops and like drugs; and lip creams and like cosmetics.

[0616] For preparation of a variety of compositions of the invention, insofar as the final products comprise sucralose and either menthol or carvone, the timing and order of addition of these components are not critical. The method for adding these components is not critical, either. Sucralose may be used in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or in the form of a solution.

[0617] The amount of sucralose to be added to the flavor composition is not particularly limited, insofar as it is effective in enhancing flavors (cool flavor, refreshing flavor, etc.) of the flavor component contained in the flavor composition. The amount may be suitably selected depending on the kind of flavor composition and the kind and amount of flavor component contained therein. Although not restricted, the amount of sucralose may be suitably selected from, for example, 0.00001 to 0.2% by weight, preferably 0.0001 to 0.05% by weight, based on 100% by weight of the flavor composition. The sweetness of sucralose itself becomes prominent in a concentration of about 0.0006% by weight or higher. Accordingly, when a low sweetness is desired, sucralose may be used below the above concentration. Such amount can optionally be adjusted by a person of skill in the art within the ordinary skill level in the art.

[0618] According to the present invention, addition of sucralose enhances flavor of menthol, carvone or the like contained in the composition, and thus provides flavor compositions with significantly improved cool flavor and refreshing flavor unique to the flavor. Accordingly, even a reduced amount of the flavor component can provide the contemplated long-term cool flavor and refreshing flavor, so that comfortable use can be ensured without the necessity of using a large amount of the flavor component which would cause disadvantages (e.g., acridity, bitterness). Sucralose, which is a non-cariogenic low-calory sweetener, functions also as a sweetener or a taste modifier in confections such as chewing gums and candies, and compositions for oral cavity such as mouthwashes and mouth sprays, thus being valuable in this respect, also.

[0619] The flavor composition of the present invention may contain other optional components usually used in this type of composition, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention. The optional components may be suitably selected depending on the type and form of the composition.

[0620] The present invention provides new use of sucralose as a flavor enhancer for enhancing cool flavor of the flavor component such as menthol or carvone. The enhancer comprises at least sucralose and may further contain other sweeteners than sucralose, flavors, preservatives, stabilizers and like other components, unless they lessen the effects of the present invention.

[0621] The enhancer of the present invention may be in the form of a solid such as a powder or granules, or in the form of a solution. The enhancer is added in any of these forms to the above-mentioned various compositions at any stage in the preparation process. The addition of the enhancer can enhance flavors of menthol and mints contained in the compositions, especially oral compositions such as foods, mouthwash solutions and like compositions for oral cavity, so that flavor compositions with improved cool flavor and refreshing flavor after use can be prepared or obtained.

[0622] The timing of addition of the enhancer is not particularly limited. The amount of the enhancer to be added to the composition can be suitably selected based on the aforementioned amount of sucralose to be added to the flavor composition of the invention or the amount of sucralose to be added to menthol or the like.

[0623] Further, the present invention provides a method for enhancing flavor of flavor compositions, which comprises incorporating the effective amount of sucralose into the aforementioned various flavor compositions, and a process for producing flavor compositions with improved flavors, which comprises incorporating said effective amount of sucralose into the flavor compositions.

Sweetening Compositions

Example (I-1-1)

Fructose-Containing Sweetening Composition

[0625] To aliquots of a 10% aqueous solution of fructose (room temperature) was added sucralose at final concentrations of 0%, 0.0002%, 0.0004% and 0.0006%, and the resulting compositions were evaluated for the quality of sweetness. As a result, whereas a mild impact of sweetness followed by a sharp cut-off was noted at 0% sucralose, addition of sucralose resulted in the development of sucrose-like notes of sweetness with a body, ameliorating the sweetness of fructose. At formulating levels up to 0.0004%, sucralose caused substantially no potentiation of sweetness intensity but imparted a feeling of body.

Example (I-1-2)

Fructose-Containing Sweetening Composition

[0626] To aliquots of a 10% aqueous solution of inverted sugar (fructose content 50%)(room temperature) was added sucralose at final concentrations of 0%, 0.0002%, 0.0004% and 0.0006%, and the resulting compositions were evaluated for the quality of sweetness. As a result, whereas a mild impact of sweetness followed by a sharp cut-off was noted at 0% sucralose, addition of sucralose resulted in the development of sucrose-like notes of sweetness with a body, ameliorating the sweetness of the fructose contained in the inverted sugar.

Example (I-1-3)

Fructose-Containing Sweetening Composition

[0627] To aliquots of a 10% aqueous solution of a commercial honey (containing fructose) (room temperature) was added sucralose at final concentrations of 0%, 0.0002%, 0.0004% and 0.0006%, and the resulting compositions were evaluated for the quality of sweetness. As a result, whereas a mild impact of sweetness followed by a clear cut-off was noted at 0% sucralose, addition of sucralose resulted in the development of sucrose-like notes of sweetness with a body, ameliorating the sweetness of the fructose occurring in the honey.

[0680] The above results indicate that blending a gluconate with sucralose corrects for the inherent flavor drawback (degree of sweetness, quality of sweetness) of sucralose to some extent and, hence, leads to a synergistic improvement in overall flavor. Thus, the spectrum of substrate foods which had been restricted by the lingering sweetness and lack of body of sucralose can now be broadened so that this sweetener can now be utilized with advantage in the whole gumut of foods and beverages inclusive of carbonated drinks, fruit drinks, coffee, nonalcoholic beverages, milk drinks, tea drinks, bakery foods, noodles and vermicelli, confections, pickles, sauces, farm and animal products, and fish products.

[0698] It became clear that by formulating sucralose, the off-flavor (gluey flavor) originating from the casein in milk protein can be masked to a significant extent. It is, therefore, considered possible to expand the scope of application of casein which has heretofore been delimited by said gluey flavor, suggesting that casein can now be used not only in foods such as imitation cheese, coffee whitener, bakery products, etc. but also broadly in the field of pharmaceutical additives.

Example (II-1-2(3))
