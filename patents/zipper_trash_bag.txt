Abstract

There is nothing more frustrating than seeing strewn trash at the curb and down the street, when you are trying to leave to get to a meeting, work or school. The Zipper Trash Bag will keep unpleasant odors locked inside. Due to a lack of food odors, which attract rodents, dogs or other pests that tend to invade your tied garbage sacks, chances are that your garbage will sit undisturbed until pickup time. This will assist the communities in keeping their curbs and streets clean. “With the zipper concept, the air surrounding the bag will be odor free, whether the bag is in the kitchen, in the dumpster, or on the curb.”

Claim(s), Drawing Sheet(s), and Figure(s)

Claim

1. The Zipper Trash Bag will prevent unpleasant odors from escaping into our living areas. One can keep adding to the bag until it is sufficiently full, closing the zipper after each deposit. Again the idea is to keep the unpleasant garbage scent from invading the area around it.
